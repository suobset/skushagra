  "description": "A central repository containing all my Undergraduate Research and Projects, including some products and websites. These were mainly official in some nature, and are different from projects that I had done in my spare time (which are listed under Misc.). There are 3 main categories: Projects that I did under my iCons affiliation, CICS affiliation (for a class/course), and CICS Competitions. Individual Projects have been listed out after these first 3 categories, making it easier to browse through (though information may have been repeated).",
