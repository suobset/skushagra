  "description": "I proudly display my FSF membership badge on my website as a dedicated advocate for libre software, championing freedom, privacy, and collaboration, in line with the principles of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). However, my allegiance lies with these principles, not with individuals. I do not seek association with prominent figures within the FSF or anything beyond the essential tenets encapsulated by the four fundamental freedoms.",
