However, we are back and kicking: and I hope that I will be able to keep this momentum up next week as well. In today\'s newsletter, I would love to highlight some fun code I wrote for my Honors Thesis last semester.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThe banner for this newsletter was taken on my trip to Washington D.C. Fall 2023, during the U.S. Census Department\'s Justice Week Event. I was one of the 6 people who worked on [ASSERT](https://suobset.github.io/assert), a GIS Web-App that directs emergency responders (like Eversource, National Grid) to counties that are more vulnerable to energy inequity. A lot of data processing and web development later, we were able to successfully demo our product, which earnwed us a spot on the Census Department\'s [website](https://opportunity.census.gov/showcase/?year=2023&partner-agency=Department+of+Energy). \\n\\nMore details on ASSERT can be found in the Research Section of my website [here](https://skushagra.com/docs/research/ongoing#umass-integrated-concentration-in-sciences-icons), though once the project is done forever the location may move to the [iCons Page here](https://skushagra.com/docs/research/icons).\\n\\n## The Times of Uncertainty, and my love for PyGDB\\n\\nIt is during the times of uncertainty that I believe the best things happen. Such was the case for ASSERT mentioned above, and I believe such will be the case for life ahead. I touched upon how I wanted to work in Systems in Grad School in my last post, and so I thought I\'d go a little deeper into my biggest formal systems project as of right now: the Honors Thesis. \\n\\nThe following is not going to be a deep dive into the intricacies of my project, I\'d rather have people look out for my formal thesis for that one. However, I do want to pick out a certain aspect of the project, in an effort to hopefully demonstrate my approach towards problem solving. \\n\\n## Background\\n\\nFor my thesis, I am trying to compare performance differences between RUST and C++. I go more over the details in the Research -> Ongoing portion of my website, but in a nutshell here\'s the workflow\\n\\n* Write the same program on RUST and C++\\n* Execute and extract the Assembly (on x86 platforms)\\n* Assemble and run, and trace the assembly\'s execution\\n* Analyze trace files\\n\\nMy big hurdle in the past semester was point 3, the tracing of an Assembly file\'s run. I wanted to basically capture each Assembly instruction (for jumps and compare), and write them out to a file as they got executed. Here\'s the story of how I achieved it:\\n\\n## Tracers\\n\\nUntil 2 semesters ago, I had dealt with a lot of techniques pertaining to decompilation, reverse engineering, and the like. The most stable way to parse through an Assembly File was this RUST program I came up with:\\n\\n```cpp\\nuse std::arch::asm;\\n\\npub fn assembly() {\\n    unsafe {\\n        asm!(\\n            // paste the assembly code here\\n        );\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nHowever, this approach caused a lot of issues. For once, it introduced RUST overhead, which would skew off calculations if we are trying to compare between RUSt and C++. Moreover, there was still no way of actually running Assembly on bare metal and recording metrics off of that.\\n\\nWe needed to put decompilation, Ghidra, and RUST Inline Assembly aside; we needed to start from scratch.\\n\\nTo begin, I wrote a small program serving as a testbench, and extracted the x86 Asm:\\n\\n```cpp\\nint main(){\\n    int j = 0;\\n    for(int i = 0; i < 10; ++i){\\n        j = j + 100;\\n        if(i % 2 == 0){\\n            j = j - 1;\\n        }else{\\n            j = j + 1;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return 0;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nI extracted the x86 Asm, and tried to make some changes to the bare files in a manner that would print a statement on the terminal before every jump.\\n\\nThis method was inspired by Prof. Joe Chiu\'s Python Bytecode Tracer, which adds similar print statements in the Python Bytecode to trace the same. Here\'s a [link](https://github.com/terry3800/python_tracing_tool-1). The choice of the registers here was based on ones that store variables in the x86 documentation, and through lots of trial and error and reading documentations. \\n\\nFor now, we are also only tracing Jumps and Compares.\\n\\nMy x86 Asm implementation was pretty janky, here\'s what a Snippet looks like:\\n\\n```py\\n.LBB0_1:                                # =>This Inner Loop Header: Depth=1\\n\\t# User Code\\n\\t lea \\t.LBB0_1_message(%rip), %rdi\\n\\t call \\tprintf\\n\\t# User Code\\n\\tlea \\t.LBB0_7_message(%rip), %rdi\\n\\tcall \\tprintf\\n\\tcmpl\\t$10, -8(%rbp)\\n\\tjge\\t.LBB0_7\\n\\t# User Code\\n\\tlea \\t.No_jmp_message(%rip), %rdi\\n\\tcall \\tprintf\\n\\n# User code below serving as helper functions to print\\n.LBB0_1_message:\\n\\t.asciz\\t\\"jmp .LBB0_1\\\\n\\"\\n.LBB0_7_message:\\n\\t.asciz\\t\\"jmp .LBB0_7\\\\n\\"\\n.No_jmp_message:\\n\\t.asciz\\t\\"No Jmp\\\\n\\"\\n```\\n\\nThis, did not work. The registers ```%rip``` and ```%rdi``` would get severly messed up, and result in a plethora of Segfaults that were honestly near impossible to debug. \\n\\nMost importantly, we were messing with the values in pre-defined registers, which could (and did) mess up program execution. So, the problem persisted and we marched forward bravely. \\n\\nI tried to use a stack to maintain the old values of ```%rip``` and ```%rdi```, do the print, and then pop those values back into the respective registers. Equally janky snippet:\\n\\n```py\\n.LBB0_1:                                # =>This Inner Loop Header: Depth=1\\n\\t# Save the values of %rip and %rdi onto the stack\\n    pushq   %rip\\n    pushq   %rdi\\n    \\n    # Load the address of the message string onto %rdi\\n    lea     .LBB0_1_message(%rip), %rdi\\n    \\n    # Call printf\\n    call    printf\\n\\n    # Restore the values of %rip and %rdi from the stack\\n    popq    %rdi\\n    popq    %rip\\n\\t# Save the values of %rip and %rdi onto the stack\\n    pushq   %rip\\n    pushq   %rdi\\n\\n.LBB0_1_message:\\n\\t.asciz\\t\\"jmp .LBB0_1\\\\n\\"\\n```\\n\\nMy third, equally short-lived implementation was to use my own variables instead of the Stack. I also tried printing using my own variables. Both did not work:\\n\\n```py\\n\\t# User Code\\n\\t# pushq\\t%rip\\n\\tmovq    %rdi, saved_rdi\\n\\tlea \\t.No_jmp_message(%rip), %rdi\\n\\tcall \\tprintf\\n\\tmovq    saved_rdi, %rdi\\n```\\n\\nThis also did not work, probably due to the reasons mentioned before. After all, the Stack was just a band-aid to solve an issue that was secondary; the execution of this Assembly code was still causing issues with tracing. \\n\\nFor one, if we were to measure how efficient a programming language was based on tracing their Assembly outputs, it seemed counter-intuitive to edit such Assembly files. \\n\\nBut secondly, the execution of all these three edits seemed dubious at best. Even if we run the same program with the same inputs, sometimes these prints would work and sometimes they wouldn\'t. They were not reliable at all, and did not provide an accurate trace. \\n\\nSo far, here\'s a list of everything wrong with this method:\\n\\n* Does not work well\\n    * Messes up stacks, registers, values of core registers\\n    * Segmentation Fault Minefield\\n    * Needs to uniformly change Asm files through a janky script\\n    * And pray that it executes well\\n* For real life programs with hundreds of files, does not work well\\n    * Cannot go outside the context of one file\\n    * Can break interoperability\\n* Most importantly, false metrics can be analyzed, since we are adding our own jumps and calls\\n\\nIt was time to switch my methodology. \\n\\n## A Debugging Approach to Tracing\\n\\nI went back to the drawing board for a bit. What we want to do is trace a file; we are essentially looking at this Assembly File and seeing it\'s behaviors across different commands, variables, and the like. \\n\\nWhat I needed, was a debugging approach to tracing. Here\'s a quick cut to the chase, and a rundown of what I ended up doing. \\n\\nMy primary debugger for low level systems stuff has been GNU GDB so far, and I am super comfortable with it. By nature, it has a lot of extensible capabilities, owing partly to the amount of time and community surrounding its development. \\n\\nUtilizing GNU GDB as our debugging tool, we leverage the 1v1 binary compatibility of LLVM. The x86 assembly generated from LLVM LLC seamlessly integrates with GDB, enabling us to step into each component, make observations, and generate a trace file. By assembling the x86 assembly with the appropriate -g flags, we can then employ GDB to generate a trace, providing valuable insights into the execution process.\\n\\nI found PyGDB, a Python Package that acts as an API to GDB and helps us extend the functionality. So here\'s how everything works at the end:\\n\\n* Compile each program till the Assembly\\n* Assembly with GDB flags\\n* Start GDB, and my own Python program that notices each GDB step and notes down the execution state\\n* Output this data to a file, and you have a trace :D\\n\\nHere\'s the initial Python Script I had, for Jumps:\\n\\n```py\\nimport gdb\\n\\n# Define the file path where you want to save the log\\nlog_file_path = \\"./gdb.trace\\"\\n\\n# Initialize a flag to track whether a \'jne\' or \'jge\' instruction was executed\\njmp_detected = False\\n\\ndef log_jmp_event(event):\\n    global jmp_detected  # Use the global flag to track if \'jne\' or \'jge\' was detected\\n    pc = int(gdb.parse_and_eval(\\"$pc\\"))\\n    instruction = gdb.execute(\\"x/i \\" + hex(pc), to_string=True)\\n    \\n    if \\"jne\\" in instruction or \\"jge\\" in instruction:\\n        jmp_detected = True\\n        with open(log_file_path, \\"a\\") as log_file:\\n            log_file.write(f\\"{hex(pc)}: {instruction}\\\\n\\")\\n\\n# Connect the stop event to the log_jmp_event function\\ngdb.events.stop.connect(log_jmp_event)\\n\\n# Define a command to check if \'jne\' or \'jge\' was executed and write to the log file\\nclass CheckJmpCommand(gdb.Command):\\n    def __init__(self):\\n        super(CheckJmpCommand, self).__init__(\\"checkjmp\\", gdb.COMMAND_USER)\\n\\n    def invoke(self, arg, from_tty):\\n        global jmp_detected\\n        with open(log_file_path, \\"a\\") as log_file:\\n            if jmp_detected:\\n                log_file.write(\\"jne/jge was executed.\\\\n\\")\\n            else:\\n                log_file.write(\\"jne/jge was NOT executed.\\\\n\\")\\n        jmp_detected = False  # Reset the flag for the next check\\n\\nCheckJmpCommand()\\n```\\n\\nHere\'s how the actual execution takes place:\\n\\n* Start GDB and load your Assembly files\\n* Attach this Code to GDB\\n* Run, step into each command\\n* During each step:\\n    * Detect Jumps\\n    * If a jump is detected while executing code\\n        * Log it in a file\\n* Repeat until end\\n\\n![GDB With Test Program](./assets/image.png)\\n\\nHere\'s what the snippet of an end trace for just Jumps looks like:\\n\\n```\\n0x40120d: => 0x40120d <_main+71>:\\tjne    0x401219 <_main+83>\\n\\n0x40128b: => 0x40128b <list_directory+107>:\\tjne    0x40125b <list_directory+59>\\n\\n0x40128b: => 0x40128b <list_directory+107>:\\tjne    0x40125b <list_directory+59>\\n\\n0x7ffff7fdc895: => 0x7ffff7fdc895 <_dl_fixup+117>:\\tjne    0x7ffff7fdca9c <_dl_fixup+636>\\n\\n0x7ffff7fdc89f: => 0x7ffff7fdc89f <_dl_fixup+127>:\\tjne    0x7ffff7fdca70 <_dl_fixup+592>\\n```\\n\\nThe best part: the Python as an API implementation is extensible, and can incorporate really any variables or states that you\'d want to incorporate. \\n\\nThe above is the initial version of the tracer I had, and I\'d be very excited to show the end results soon as my thesis comes out. \\n\\nI know some of the explanations seem cut short, but I am saving them up for the thesis. This blog was to just give some hints on what I am doing, and how Systems programming can sometimes be a success through entirely unexpected means. \\n\\nUntil next time :D\\n\\n![RUST Example](./assets/image2.png)"},{"id":"newsletter3","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/newsletter3","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-27-newsletter3/index.md","title":"Career Optimism, and History.","description":"Grayson Hall, Newsletter 3 Image","date":"2024-02-27T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 27, 2024","tags":[{"label":"newsletter","permalink":"/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"academia","permalink":"/blog/tags/academia"},{"label":"life","permalink":"/blog/tags/life"}],"readingTime":9.375,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kushagra Srivastava","title":"I write, code, and create.

The issues that come with scheduling problems, or a general lack of motivation towards doing something start to dwindle by the time it is the third week of committing to a new habit.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n## Momentum\\n\\nIn fact, it has been a  long standing urban myth that any new habit takes about 21 days to form (current research pinpoints that number to be more in the ballpark of 66 days, though the range goes from 18 - 256 days depending on environments). As described by Maxwell Maltz in his book [Psycho Cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Cybernetics), the key to personal success lies in understanding the dynamic interplay between the mind and one\'s self image. The author\'s notion is that it takes 21 days to form a habit, stemming from his experience as a Plastic Surgeon wherein it took 21 days for his patients to accustom themselves to their new physical appearances. \\n\\nWhile newer research has disproven on the notion of \\"21 days\\", one valid argument that stems from the same is the fact that a consistent momentum towards an activity awakens motivation to continue on the same trajectory. It\'s why apps like Duolingo have a \\"streak\\" function built in, you do not want it to reset to zero. Starting new hobbies, there is an initial inertia that needs to be overcome. Once overcome, the momentum carries you forward.\\n\\nI am happy to be slowly getting there. However, this is still a very \\"we\'re figuring this out as we move along\\" type of newsletter. Maybe there\'s some beauty in it.\\n\\n## Priorities, Changes, and the Dillemma of the Current\\n\\nLately, I have been feeling a little more anxious with each passing day due to many reasons. With my Honors Thesis, Undergraduate Career, and Job wrapping up, I await results for my Graduate Admissions. However, I also do believe that opportunities like such provide an excellent opportunity for reflection and appreciation for everything that has been done. \\n\\nI will possibly write a different post in the future about things I am actually proud of in my undergraduate career, since my undergrad career is not quite over yet. Currently, I want to take a moment to list down the things that I am actually looking forward to:\\n\\n### Grad School, and how we got here\\n\\nFirst and foremost, I am looking forward to grad school. No other way of saying it: but the fact that I might be able to get an opportunity to work on the field that I have wanted to join since I was a middle schooler excites me to no end. I think this would be a very good moment to record how I got into this field:\\n\\nMy foray into Computer Science stemmed from a love of tinkering with them in middle school, starting from my first computer:\\n\\n![First Computer](./assets/logo.png)\\n\\nThis beauty ran Windows XP (Win 95 in the above screenshot) with half a gig of DDR2 RAM, 64GB storage, and an Intel Atom processor that was slower than a Lada. However, it being slow was a virtue; given Windows ran like absolute garbage on it, I was compelled to find methods to tinker with and get the most out of this laptop. \\n\\nI Googled \\"alternatives to Windows\\" as a 7th grade kid, and installed Ubuntu on this computer (thinking what could possibly go wrong). Well, to my surprise, nothing really did go wrong (a lesson I learnt in the future that it was almost miraculous for nothing to go wrong with Linux installs, especially on lesser-known hardware). Ubuntu became my first foray into the world of Linux and Bash scripting (not much you could do on Linux by just relying on the GUI tools). \\n\\nThis trend continued when I got my first proper computer, an HP laptop which was slow due to Windows 10\'s bad resource management and it running on a HDD instead of an SSD. The Ubuntu trend continued, and exposure to the command line that early taught me Bash Scripting, Python, Web Dev. and such. I started off creating hobby websites and apps for Android, most for my own fulfillment.\\n\\nIn fact, one of the earlier versions of this very domain used to be a website called \\"Guitar Rocks\\", a name I came up with during middle school but a website curated and implemented during high school. Mentioned in my undergraduate college applications, it became a cornerstone of my initial interest towards Computer Science, and merging my love for music + art with code (which has since evolved into perceiving code as a hobby). \\n\\nWhile I worked on other interesting projects in high school (creating an alumni portal for my old school, or interning at Tata Consultancy Services), it was during university that I discovered my love for Systems and Compilers. \\n\\n### Operating Systems and Compilers\\n\\nSpecial shoutout to Tim Richards and Operating Systems (377), for getting me interested into this stuff. Long story short(ish), my love for CS began from tinkering with systems and computers. A lot of what I did over High School revolved around scripting, \\"reverse engineering\\", or building solutions that would solve a specific need of mine. \\n\\nI fell in love with Operating Systems upon realizing that this was the biggest playground for tinkering with and understanding systems. CS 377 walked through each element of an Operating System, and I got familiar with the ideas of Scheduling, Context Switching, Multitasking, and so much more. Essentially, this course became the crux knowledge for my current Honors Thesis: Comparing and Contrasting Performance Differences Between RUST and C++ on x86 Platforms. \\n\\nThings got even better when we were exposed to tinkering basically whatever in the Honors Colloquium of this class. We studied MIT PDOS xv6, an educational Operating System built for the RISC-V platform. Reading through the code, making changes to the Scheduling algorithms, and just trying to study the system was quite-possibly the biggest eye opener I have had in my Undergraduate Career, and was my cue to follow this domain to wherever it leads. \\n\\nI love studying systems and tinkering with them. My goal, especially with Grad School, is to understand everything that there is about the intricate nature of computing, and to contribute something meaningful to the field. The idea of tinkeirng with systems, understanding their complexities, making it simple, and finding new breakthroughs excites me to no end. \\n\\nI genuinely look forward to Grad School, crossing my fingers for that Early March Decisions. \\n\\n## Honors Thesis\\n\\nLet us circle back for a quick moment. I mentioned about my Honors Thesis, here\'s what\'s happened and what I look forward to:\\n\\n* I want to compare RUST and C++ as hey are two of the most popular low-level languages\\n  * x86 Architecture as a baseline, Apple Silicon and ARM are still novel.\\n  * More theoritical in nature, nothing that can be solved by just \\"throwing more hardware towards the problem\\"\\n    * Consistent findings ranging from RasPis, consumer laptops, to High Performance Computing\\n  * LLVM base to maintain consistency\\n* How:\\n  * Make the same exact programs in both languages\\n  * Trace the x86 Assembly output as it executes the program\\n  * Collect traces and analyze how many CPU resources used per language\\n    * Take into account RUST\'s added security features and calculate performance overhead vs. developer peace\\n\\nI am currently writing down findings. I very recently made the repository public for the Tracing tool, since that part has been done. I look forward to the completion of this project as well.\\n\\nTracer: [https://github.com/cics-syslab/RUST-Tracing-Tool](https://github.com/cics-syslab/RUST-Tracing-Tool)\\n\\nMore information on this soon.\\n\\n## Life\\n\\nI think one of the big things that I have started to look forward is the trajectory of my own life, and how things pan out. The banner for this post was taken in Greenough Hall during a particularly-lonely evening, when I did not know how anything was panning out. After all, it was during Sophomore Year; I didn\'t even have any friends here given my Freshman year was all on Zoom due to the pandemic. \\n\\nI think to finish this letter, I\'d like to look back and pay some gratitude to the things that life has given me so far. I feel that I get caught up so much in trying to grasp where my future is leading me that I can forget how much has been achieved as well (I think we all do, to some extent).\\n\\nI came in the U.S. having absolutely no clue as to how to navigate life, for the most part. Not just pertaining to my career, but really anything. Yes, I found my calling in Systems and I hope to hear back some good news in the upcoming weeks, but I also found a social circle that is equally into research and creating the world a better place. I found a partner who has been absolutely amazing and receptive of all my feelings and struggles. \\n\\nI have found an amazing group of people to work with, ranging from students to professors. Personal projects such as MorbiOS and Saberstat are amazingly beautiful, and let me bring deranged ideas to life with other people. My career at Smith College has been the most amazing work experience, despite a tough job market. I extend my thanks to Prof. Ileana Streinu for the same.\\n\\nProfessor Scott Auerbach and the DOE TOP Challenge was one of the best projects I have undertaken, and ASSERT has been quite-possibly one of my first widespread in-use Open Source products. I also extend my thanks to him introducing the iCons program to me, quite possibly the biggest driver of my love for research and desire to continue in academia. Profs. Joe Chiu and Tim Richards have been amazing at fostering my love for systems and helping me conduct my Hons. Thesis.\\n\\nSpecial mention to Prof. Parviz Kermani, for introducing Networking Architecture and exposing me to the Networking lab. WHilen it is just a course, I\'d say it has been the most influential set of courses for me alongside 377 (OS) and 230 (Intro. to Systems).\\n\\nI realize that my growth in the field has been a team effort including many people and events. University has been the biggest bloessing to my life: I went from knowing nothing (except having an interest in the field), to knowing exactly what I want to pursue.\\n\\nI am grateful to all the people that have helped me foster my love for research and computation. This was not a vaccum, and I genuinely appreciate a lot of people (including all the people that I was not even able to mention, but helped me tremenduously).\\n\\nI look forward to continuing my journey of understanding, implementing, and contributing to Systems Development. I am optimistic, albeit a little anxious. However, I am determined.\\n\\nThis newsletter has been fun to write.

[Fleet Robotics](https://greentownlabs.com/members/fleet-robotics/) uses roomba-like robots to clean biofuling, [De-Ice](https://greentownlabs.com/members/de-ice/) uses electric pulses over the body of an aircraft to de-ice the airplane, and [Cyvl.ai](https://greentownlabs.com/members/cyvl-ai/) uses Computer Vision to aid local governments in analyzing what road signs & traffic equipment needs maintainance. \\n\\nHuge shoutout to Marinna Teixeira \'16 ([@marinnateix](https://instagram.com/marinnateix)) and Deanna Kenyon \'19 ([@deerosekenyon](https://instagram.com/deerosekenyon)), at Greentown Labs in Somerville, MA for organizing this and graciously welcoming the 11th and 12th iCons cohorts to Greentown. \\n\\n![Greentown Labs Visit](./assets/greentownInsta.png)\\n\\n## Vibin\' out\\nThese months currently feel like an Academic Limbo: a place where I am a bit uncertain as to how things may be headed. I am waiting on Grad Schools, finishing up on my Honors Thesis, and writing my drafts for [MassURC](https://honorspaths.honors.umass.edu/massurc), on top of already being committed to academic work. Personally, I have felt that while I do have a good framework of dealing with stress, I need to realize that I am not alone, and others are in this same journey as me. \\n\\nI have been looking at ways to destress at times, and outside of my usual hobbies of Photography + Newslettring, I have found myself surfing the web to find hidden gems. One of them is a web-based game, [slowroads.io](https://slowroads.io). Put on some music, and drive on an endless road (in different times of day and weather conditions).\\n\\n![Slowroads](./assets/slowroads.png)\\n\\nNow, want some music to go along? [Poolsuite](https://poolsuite.net) has you covered with a website inspired by old MacOS and Windows, with 90s ads playing on loop and endless mixtapes on different radio channels. It is the perfect blend of neo-retroism.\\n\\n![Poolsuite](./assets/poolsuite.png)\\n\\nPoolsuite and Slowroads are not my products, and belong to their respective owners. I just loved finding out about them.\\n\\n## Some Finechive Updates\\n\\nFunnily enough, I have been writing blogs and online content in an on and off basis since 2017. The Finechive is also a place wherein I want to archive all my previous blogs and websites. It is a continual process, but look out at the [archive](/archive) page for more info. A quick debrief:\\n\\n* Minded Mindlessness was the last big blog effort I ran, from 2017-2019. \\n* I had a high school blog before that\\n* I used this domain between 2019-2020 for teaching music.\\n* I now write this newsletter here :)\\n\\nFinding the bits of online content here and there has been a transformative experience for myself, to say the least. Minded Mindlessness was an effort with my then-partner, and reading that especially has instilled this deep sense of appreciation of how far we come in life. I was like 16 when i wrote those. While I have matured so much more than where I was at that time, so many of my traits and perspectives on life can be traced back to the moments when I last wrote that endeavour.\\n\\nSimilarly, my interests in my field can be seen today in my first blog as well, which was such a weird endeavour. I write about some politics, AI, Machine Learning, despite just having a very novel outlook towards such things. Yet, here I am specializing in the very thing, as well as working in low-level systems (stuff that makes everything else run, computationally speaking).\\n\\nIt\'s a bit beautiful, but I love looking back at life like this. Also, doesn\'t hurt you to reach out and say thanks to the people in your past, even after years of disconnect. Life\'s beautiful. \\n\\nOutside of this, I think I will keep writing a mix of wacky internet stuff + personal stories and opinions on here. I\'m still figuring this newsletter out, but I am excited about it\'s future. \\n\\nIt can become a bit tricky at times to know the direction of a specific creative endeavour. However, for the time being I am just uploading archives of these past experiences on this website. It is all completely done, except Minded Mindlessness. I will post an edit to this space once that is done as well.\\n\\n<hr />"},{"id":"newsletter1","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/newsletter1","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-13-newsletter1/index.md","title":"Dreamlike Uncanniness, and Data Bending","description":"Finechive 1 Banner","date":"2024-02-13T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 13, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Open Source","permalink":"/blog/tags/open-source"},{"label":"Aesthetics","permalink":"/blog/tags/aesthetics"},{"label":"Art","permalink":"/blog/tags/art"}],"readingTime":6.075,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kushagra Srivastava","title":"I write, code, and create.

It feels so weirdly amazing to stick to a schedule, it feels beautiful and scary.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nThere have been quite a few times when I have talked about aesthetics, and I still believe that they are the best way to express myself. I have a [post here from last year diving into Liminal Spaces](/blog/liminal-spaces-art-of-appreciating), and to this day they capture the feeling of loneliness and eerieness perfectly. \\n\\nA lot of the pictures I take pertain to outdoor Liminal Spaces. It is an interest that started during the Pandemic lockdowns, especially in a context where I was joining online Zoom meetings from the other corner of the globe. Going from interacting with over 15-20 people at a time on Discord to absolute silence at 4AM on the click of a button, I did not yet realize that I was living in a Liminal Space. \\n\\nI go into great lengths to describe the journey into this rabbithole in that earlier post I have linked above, and would love for y\'all to check out the same.\\n\\nIf we go back to the past post I just mentioned, I referred a [video](https://youtu.be/olsXUqKTWgI?si=QI0p7Sx4qFIeTU9a) by Cresendex on what defines a Liminal Space. To save some time, they define the three basic characterstics of Liminal Spaces:\\n\\n* A transitory space\\n* A sense of nostalgia\\n* A dreamlike uncanniness \\n\\nWhile it is typically easy to take indoor hallway pictures (since they quite literally are Liminal Spaces), the feeling is even more difficult to capture outdoors, especially during broad daylight. However, years of capturing Liminal Spaces has made me pretty comfortable, with that too. \\n\\nSo far, I have achieved what was to be achieved in the first two. This post is about achieving the third.\\n\\n## Spaces So Far\\n\\nThe first steps I took in this journey were transitory spaces. They were the easiest to capture, I knew I had to take them on a road trip or similar. \\n\\nA trick I did in the beginning of this journey was to create a more \\"dreamlike ethereal\\" feeling by heavily distorting the colors of the pictures. Nevertheless, I have had some absolutely gorgeous images, and here are some that I have taken over the years since I first started:\\n\\n![Empty Field](./assets/1.png)\\n\\nDistorted colors to achieve dreamlike feel, taken in 2020.\\n\\n![Gas Station](./assets/2.png)\\n\\nGas Station in Hatfield, MA. Increased saturation, dimmed brightness. Taken in 2023.\\n\\n![Lederle at Night](./assets/3.png)\\n\\nLederle at Night. Very minor edits, this is an actual liminal space I experience. Taken in 2023.\\n\\n![Abandoned Lederle Physics Lab](./assets/4.png)\\n\\nA sunset through an abandoned lab at Lederle, minor edits. Taken in 2024.\\n\\nI have more pictures I have taken in the other post, and also will be uploading them all (plus unpublished pictures) once the Photography page is up and running. But, we have nailed the first two aspects of a Liminal Space.\\n\\n## So...Data Bending?\\n\\nComputers represent an astounding feat of engineering, functioning at their core by storing and manipulating data in the form of bits. The nature or structure of the data becomes inconsequential; in computer memory, all information is universally encoded as bits (you can verify this by opening any file in an editor, not just text files).\\n\\nAt its essence, we encounter the ubiquitous entity known as a file. A file is a digital container that encapsulates information, acting as a fundamental building block in the realm of computing. Whether it houses text, images, or complex algorithms, a file serves as the elemental unit through which computers organize, store, and retrieve data.\\n\\nFile formats, as we recognize them today, simply provide a standardized way to designate the type of a file, ensuring clarity and preventing user error. This facilitates seamless interaction with relevant software. However, it\'s vital to recognize that a file format is essentially a tag\u2014a means for programmers to establish standardized characteristics. For instance, an MP3 file is tagged as a music file, with bits encoding sound wavelengths over time. This tag allows relevant software to recognize and process the file accordingly.\\n\\nNevertheless, beneath the surface, all files share a fundamental similarity, and are stored in the exactly same manner. The distinction lies in the representation of data within the container. This brings us to the intriguing concept of data bending.\\n\\nConsider a picture, fundamentally a 2D array of pixel colors, where each point in the plane is assigned a specific color. This 2D array is processed by photo software to meet our requirements. Similarly, an audio file is also represented by a 2D array, and music-making software anticipates this format. By altering the file format of a picture, it is possible to deceive the music software into interpreting it as audio\u2014effectively *bending* the data and producing captivating glitch effects.\\n\\nLet\'s dive into this a bit more:\\n\\n## Glitching Lederle\\n\\nWe are going to use this image as our testbench.\\n\\n![Lederle on a Cloudy Morning](./assets/5.png)\\n\\n(Have we identified my favourite building on the UMass Amherst Campus??)\\n\\nI altered the file format to MP3 without making any adjustments to the image itself. As expected, given that a file serves as a mere container, Audacity\u2014a digital audio workstation, or music editing software\u2014accepts it without issue, presuming it to be an audio file. Although no audible sound is produced, no error is triggered either.\\n\\n![Audacity taking in my \\"MP3\\"](./assets/6.png)\\n\\nNow, let\'s explore and experiment a bit! \ud83d\ude04\\n\\nI modified the pitch of the final third of the image and introduced an echo effect to the middle third. Here\'s a visual representation of the alterations in Audacity:\\n\\n![Audacity showing my image and edits](./assets/7.png)\\n\\nNow, time to export this as a RAW file, and change the format back to .bmp (uncompressed image) so that we can open it in an image viewer:\\n\\n![Audacity Edited](./assets/8.jpeg)\\n\\nWoozy, right??\\n\\nSince a file is just a container, if the data representation is close enough in the two files: we can pretty much manipulate a file format meant for one type of file in a software that was meant to edit something completely different. That, to me, is insanely cool. \\n\\nIt\'s the kind of stuff that makes my career interesting to me!! :D\\n\\n## Some more edits\\n\\nThe following are me just selecting most of the whole image (Ctrl + A messes header files and corrupts the whole thing, I am still getting the hang of it), and applying one effect to it. Enjoy :D\\n\\n![Echo](./assets/echo.jpeg)\\n\\n> Echo\\n\\n![Invert](./assets/invert.jpeg)\\n\\n> Invert\\n\\n![Pitch](./assets/pitch.png)\\n\\n> Pitch & Invert on one section\\n\\n![Reverb](./assets/reverb.png)\\n\\n> Reverb\\n\\n![Everything](./assets/everything.png)\\n\\n> Everything I mentioned above\\n\\nA screenshot of Audacity for the last edit:\\n\\n![Audacity All](./assets/audacityAll.png)\\n\\n30 seconds to about a minute: Pitch Filter\\n\\n1 Minute to about 1:50: Reverb (the narrow audio wave)\\n\\n1:50 to 2:30: Echo with a decay factor of 0.25\\n\\n2:30 to end: Invert (quite literally inverts in the audio waveform as well)\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\nFluff time :D\\n\\n### What am I listening to?\\n\\n![Tkay Maidza: Last Year Was Weird, Vol. 3](./assets/tkay.png)\\n\\n> Last Year Was Weird Vol. 3 - Tkay Maidza\\n\\n![Duster](./assets/duster.png)\\n\\n> Transmission, Flux - Duster\\n\\nThis is the end of Newsletter 1."},{"id":"newsletter time","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/newsletter time","source":"@site/blog/2024-02-08-newsletter-time/index.md","title":"Introducing a Newsletter, sort of.","description":"Newsletter Banner","date":"2024-02-08T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 8, 2024","tags":[{"label":"Newsletter","permalink":"/blog/tags/newsletter"},{"label":"Personal","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal"},{"label":"Website","permalink":"/blog/tags/website"}],"readingTime":3.025,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kushagra Srivastava","title":"I write, code, and create.

Here\'s why I say \\"sort of\\":\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n* For starters, I am not going to have an email functionality here. This is going to solely be a space for me to write down thoughts and convey them.\\n* We are not trying to build an audience, just yet. We are trying to just create something special.\\n* Threading (Tweeting on Threads) is not cutting it for me. That\'s too constraining. \\n* Each page of the Finechive relates to a big (non-career related) project. However, ideas come and go. This is the point I want to hold on to, for a bit.\\n\\n## the approach, and how it is changing.\\n\\nThe biggest problem in my approach has been the reluctance to treat this blog as a main project. So far, this has pretty much been a dump of my ideas that come and go. I have written about these ideas in great depth, but as a result I only post here very rarely. \\n\\nEvery other page in the Finechive is a project that has been going on, independent of my career (yes, even the code ones). However, that means that by nature of the projects, those pages get updated quite rarely. Granted, updates are good, but it is more of a directory of what I am doing currently (more so, what I am doing not directly in my career as such).\\n\\nIdeas, on the other hand, come and go. Ideas cannot stick to a \\"Project\\" page, they need a medium of communication. I have tried blogging before, albeit have never been able to reach the heights of my high-school blog (which remains archived for the time being). \\n\\nPivoting to a separate problem, another issue I am having is managing my creative projects. I recently got into Digital Art, Djing, and Photography (as mentioned in [a previous Blog post](https://skushagra.com/blog/dreaming)). While each of these are going to get their own pages in the Finechive, a newsletter also helps me keep myself in check, and convey the daily progress on these avenues without having to wait for sweeping changes to be made in this space.\\n\\nMost importantly, it helps me have a big picture of where each of these new creative endeavours are headed to, so that the more sweeping changes on my actual archive make sense. The creative endeavours are basically classified as Sound, Indoor Creativity, and Outdoor Creativity, They will have their own pages, but also I will put stuff here.\\n\\nThe way I see it unfolding is that Photography & Art will have merged in their own little proper finechive page (the current [Photography](https://skushagra.com/docs/finechive/photography) page), and I will have also started publishing my Music Lirary in yet another Finechive page. This is not set in stone, and will most definitely change as we keep going further into this rabbithole. For now, I am elated to have these means of creative expressions.\\n\\nEvery Tuesday at 4PM EST, I will have a new post here. Something interesting, opinionated, really anything. But I need to get a medium for a creative flow of ideas, and not just updates on the more major projects I am doing. Think of this as a \\"budget version\\" of the [Tom Scott Newsletter](https://tomscott.com/), which is free to begin with and has so clearly not been the motivation behind this idea.\\n\\nOnce I have consistently posted a newsletter for 8 Mondays, the newsletter will officially have a link on my homepage.\\n\\n<hr />"},{"id":"on-macos-and-libre-software","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/on-macos-and-libre-software","source":"@site/blog/2024-01-26-on-macos/index.md","title":"The Eternal Battle Between Libre Source Ideology, and the Macintosh","description":"Even though I am not exactly there yet, I often like to classify myself as a Libre Source Developer.

Let\'s get into this terminology first.\\n\\nLibre Source, for the most part, is very much in parallels with Open Source Development: i.e., people can see the source of your code, fork it, compile it, and distribute it. There exist different licenses that lay down the permissions for what most users can do with it. The most popular, in the Open Source world, is the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n![MIT License](./mit.jpeg)\\n\\nEssentially, this is a \\"do whatever you want- including making this closed source- as long as you retain that copyright notice\\" license.\\n\\nWhich brings to the crucial difference between Open vs. Libre: the [GPL License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html) (along with the many others, like the MPL or Apache 2.0)\\n\\n![GPL License](./gpl.jpeg)\\n\\nWithout diving too much into the text, it essentially says that any derivative works have to remain open source & accessible to all. Now, the GPL itself is sometimes criticized for being too restrictive, but the overarching theme is that any derivative work remain free (as in freedom, not in free beer), and the 4 essential freedoms are maintained here.\\n\\nI go a little bit deeper into my appreciation for the GPL in the README for [ASSERT](https://github.com/suobset/assert).\\n\\n![ASSERT Readme](./assert.jpeg)\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n## So, what is the deal with the Macintosh?\\n\\nControversial-ish opinion (coming from a Linux user): The Mac is one of the best UNIX environments today that facilitates this development. Which is weird, because the people behind the GPL (The Free Software Foundation), really do not receive it well at times given how closed the system is.\\n\\nThe Mac technically does not comply with GPL requirements, yet most of FOSS development takes place on that platform (including many new and shiny devtools). It uses quite a lot of OSS components under the hood, and comes with exceptional support, making it the default developer choice for a UNIX-based platform.\\n\\nThis means that for any developer, Macs become the default choice. And for any new developer tool, Macs become the first target platform.\\n\\nCase study: I have been wanting to try 2 different code editors (both Open Sourced), which are Mac only:\\n\\nThe first is CodeEdit, a native macOS editor which is licensed under MIT. Completely letting this slide off, the project is a native macOS one, that does not need to cater to other platforms. The focus is right there, and it is solving the issue at hand:\\n\\n![CodeEdit](./CodeEdit.jpeg)\\n\\nHowever, this rabbit hole of \\"finding a new editor\\" led me to Zed Editor, which currently got entirely Open Sourced under the GPL License, yet does not run on any Linux computer as of writing this post:\\n\\n![Zed](./zed.jpeg)\\n\\nAnd let\'s not forget the browser that I am screenshotting this on (even though it is not Open Sourced, yet:\\n\\n![Arc](./arc.jpeg)\\n\\nI do not daily this Mac. This is my old computer, which has been retired and sits as a YouTube machine.\\n\\nYet, by virtue of the Mac providing a UNIX-like experience outside the box, it has quite become the default developer platform. Even if you\'re not a Systems person like me, having a Mac gives you the freedom to make apps for any platform & an unparalleled Web-dev experience (the Mac restriction foor iOS development is purely Apple-imposed, but makes sense).\\n\\nTo me, it is fascinating to see the number of Free-as-in-Freedom software having only macOS as their targets (or Windows for some, like Notepad++).\\n\\nIt makes me keep coming back to my butterfly-keyboard thermal-throttling underpowered 2016 MacBook to experience these new developments, until they make my way to my actual daily computer :\')\\n\\nSome things here may be misunderstood so let me clear some points\\n\\n* Every project has its purpose, and needs a focus. I am not attacking any developers in this post; I am genuinely so happy to see so many new projects in the FOSS world. Zed, CodeEdit, and Arc are amazing projects and deserve all the love (& contributions)\\n* I am using these examples as a \\"case study\\". I just wanted to point out the fascinating number of FOSS projects that target closed platforms.\\n\\nBasically, what does it even mean to be \\"libre software\\"? Is it just the codebase, or do we include target devices as well?\\n\\nFun stuff.\\n\\nPS: I attach myself with the ideology side of the FSF: accessibility and user freedom, and do not attach myself with any prominent members.

Lemonade time!!\\n\\nI have been personally working with a team of 6 on [The Opportunity Project](https://opportunity.census.gov): a semester-long sprint to conduct data analysis and create a digital tool that helps address a social issue: electricity outage burden in certain communities, in the case of iCons. The project includes STEM majors from iCons, along with Dr. Scott Auerbach of iCons, and tremendous help from The Department of Energy. \\n\\nAs part of the sprint, one of us were initially invited to speak about it at Justice Week 2023: a week-long event to showcase efforts and successes towards Energy Equity. In true iCons fashion, however, we fought for everyone to be present, since everyone in their domain contributed whatever they could. \\n\\nHowever, long story short: I could not get in, mainly due to me being an International Student trying to access a Federal Building. Since the tickets and my hotel room were already booked, I am still coming along. \\n\\nThe following will be notes from my first-ever solo trip, unplanned at that. This document will keep updating until Thursday, November 2, at 12:00PM EST. The following are logs.\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n### October 31, 2023: Prelude\\n\\nThe day begins with pulling an all-nighter to complete a Networking Assignment (bad idea), which was easier than I was thinking. Apparrently, I have a tendency to make things more complicated. Nevertheless, this gave me about an hour of sleep, and I packed my stuff at 6AM and left for the shuttle. Somehow I had insanely bad sore throat in the morning, which may have resulted due to some allergies.\\n\\n![Van pic time](./vanpic.jpg)\\n\\n* Reached airport and stuff. Guy in pink unicorn suit at the counter, pretty fun. Somehow, I developed a sore throat last night thanks to allergies, so I bought some cough drops. \\n* Got some amazing pics of takeoff and landing. \\n\\n![takeoff](./takeoff.jpg)\\n\\n* Figured card situation for the train. I am collecting these cards like infinity stones in my Apple Wallet, the most powerful being the ETS \\"I took the GRE\\" card!! (/s)\\n* Got to our hotel, insane tile renovation Manhattan core sounds in the lobby. Here\'s a fresh note I wrote to communicate with the lady at the reception. The cough drops have been helping like hell. We had slightly overpriced dinner at the hotel which was fun in itself. Bought more cough drops, they have honestly been a godsend.\\n\\n![note](./note.png)\\n\\n* Prep\'d for the presentation tomorrow, wherein I gave audience notes since I am not presenting.\\n\\n### End of day 1 notes\\n\\nThe whole reason behind this specific post is that I have never had a solo trip, ever. Let alone, one that was never planned. While I was supposed to plan my trip tonight, I did not do that due to the immense amount of prep work and tiredness. Thus, we are going in blind tomorrow, and I will keep logging my experiences of my first ever solo trip as it unfolds. \\n\\nI believe that the main plan is for me to tag along with the team to be in front of DOE building, and get as many pictures there. After that, I am kind of on my own. Let\'s see how that goes...\\n\\nBefore I go to sleep: some other end-of-day photos:\\n\\n![floofies](./floofies.jpg)\\n\\nObviously, my two travel companions always stick with me. Andi & Leonardo <3\\n\\nThey\'re made of alpaca fur, and are super amazingly soft.\\n\\n![landing](./landing.jpg)\\n\\nA little bit more muted than the takeoff due to the cloudy nature. Nevertheless, I like this outcome. \\n\\n<hr />"},{"id":"the finechive","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/the finechive","source":"@site/blog/2023-10-10-the-finechive/index.md","title":"The Finechive: A Digital Garden and Archive of My Experiences","description":"Welcome","date":"2023-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"October 10, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Personal","permalink":"/blog/tags/personal"},{"label":"Website","permalink":"/blog/tags/website"},{"label":"Life","permalink":"/blog/tags/life"}],"readingTime":3.745,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kushagra Srivastava","title":"I write, code, and create.

On one hand, I find it to be one of the most approachable mediums on the Internet, far more accessible than making videos or fancy schmancy websites. On the other hand, how do you get consistency when it comes to writing down your thoughts?\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\nSee, the main issue when it coes to writing down \\"blog content\\" is that I am not a writer, nor do I have enough time to actually sit down and think of new ideas. Writing things down occurs to me sporadically: sometimes there exist things that move me to such an extent that I am compelled to write down about them. It is a fine method of doing this, especially since I am not doing this professionally, but it leaves a lot of consistency to be desired and ideas to be explored. \\n\\nOver the years, the concept of writing down things on the Internet has not been the same for me. Under the [Archive](./archive) page of this URL, you\'ll notice my previous attempts at this medium in 2017, along with another following in 2019 (which was not under this URL). It started off as a place for me to vent, and quickly moved into a text-based form of vlogging (or rather, we came back full circle on methods-of-describing-your-life). Quite honestly, I do not think that both of these intents are something that I\'d be comfortable sharing at this point, or matters that anyone will want to read about.\\n\\nI want my blog as an area to communicate on ideas, as opposed to daily occurrings. However, I also do not want to trap myself into only communicating about a specific subject matter. I want this space to flourish as a means for me to be able to communicate whatever it is that inspires me at a certain given moment, while also giving me enough creative freedom to write down abut daily occurrences shoulod something inspiring happen. Essentially, I need an archive. \\n\\nIt was about 2 days ago when upon researching into this concept, I came across the idea of a \\"Digital Garden\\". While the concept itself was born in the 90s, digital gardens have superseded the concept of \\"Personal Websites\\" into spaces that give one the flexibility to put down their thoughts on, and nurture over time. Just like the concept of a real garden, with enough time and nurturing (in the form of putting down thoughts and ideas), you can create your own digital garden as a manifestation of your ideas. The whole thing has a [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) as well :)\\n\\nThus, I am in the process of converting this space into a Digital Garden, as opposed to a blog. \\n\\n## The story behind Finechive\\n\\nAs a name, finechive = fine + archive, i.e. an archive of all the fine things in life. In practicality, the Finechive was a project that I wanted to start about a month ago: an archive of all digital media that I found valuable enough to preserve. There were just 2 issues with that concept:\\n\\n1. Copyright laws would prevent me from hosting any forms of media.\\n2. [The Internet Archive](https://archive.org) already does an excellent job of maintaining an archive, and I\'d actually encourage you to check them out and donate if possible. \\n\\nThus, the entire project has been revamped into creating a so-called \\"archive of my mind\\". I will try toput down many of my thoughts and outlooks into here, without trying to worry too much about consistency. That being said, the current iteration of finechive has some issues that I would like to resolve.\\n\\n* No information is stored into your brain as is; rather, all information is linked to one another in some way or the other. I would love to try and create a graph that can showcase all the ideas and thoughts I have written down here, and what/how they\'re linked to each other.\\n* The blog format can hinder hierarchy and organization. This is something that I\'d try to fix. \\n\\nHowever, I see these issues as mainly optional. For now, I will just keep on writing here as usual, and soon see if there is any organization that is needed to be done (or if the blog format is working out well). I will attempt to write here twice every week, also attaching pictures taken by me throughout the week.\\n\\nUntil next time."},{"id":"liminal-spaces-art-of-appreciating","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/liminal-spaces-art-of-appreciating","source":"@site/blog/2023-08-30-liminal-spaces-art-of-appreciating/index.md","title":"Liminal Spaces: the art of being in, and appreciating the in-between.","description":"Originally published by me on Medium","date":"2023-08-30T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"August 30, 2023","tags":[{"label":"Aesthetics","permalink":"/blog/tags/aesthetics"},{"label":"Liminal Space","permalink":"/blog/tags/liminal-space"},{"label":"Life","permalink":"/blog/tags/life"},{"label":"Nostalgia","permalink":"/blog/tags/nostalgia"}],"readingTime":11.065,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Kushagra Srivastava","title":"I write, code, and create.

This is a story of a particular phase of my own life, how it has been influenced by my past, and how it delves into one of my favorite aesthetics of all time.\\n\\nThis will also be an attempt to capture my version of that aesthetic.\\n\\n\x3c!-- truncate --\x3e\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\n![Chapter 1](./1.webp)\\n\\nThe beginning of what would culminate into a series of developing multiple aspects into what my life would really turn out to be started right around the corner of me transitioning from my High School phase to my University phase; at a time when every single person on the planet was transitioning away from life as they had known into one that was being navigated in the midst of a global pandemic.\\n\\nSee, change is difficult for people to grasp. While an inevitable construct, the human mind still opposes change as it then has to deal with us fighting for our survival needs, and trying to make the best of whatever situation it is that is presented to us. For me, this was a period of change in three major ways: transitioning from school to university (essentially leaving life as I had known it for over 12 years), transitioning towards navigating a world with a surreal level of precaution, and transitioning to a new country altogether to study further.\\n\\nI come from a background wherein everything that I have experienced in life has been ephemeral, especially since my family worked a profession which required us getting transferred to multiple places. Hence, while transitioning in itself has not been too difficult for me: the uncertainty of the time, coupled with me having to do this on my own for once, proved me wrong for once.\\n\\nIn between me having to embark on this journey, and staying inside due to the pandemic: I started to introspect more into my own thoughts. I had been busy with life until now: but this was the first time I slowed down, and I looked at places, people, and the surroundings that I had not really thought much about before.\\n\\n![Chapter 2](./2.webp)\\n\\nI started creating. I had never created before, even though I always knew I wanted to create. I had programmed stuff before, and I had played the guitar before. But to do something which is your own creation, from the beginning to the end? I was too scared of it. In fact, part of me is still scared of it to a great extent. It is the reason why I am so hesitant to write up anything on the platform you are reading this on.\\n\\nNevertheless, I persisted. It started with me realizing my lifelong hobby for the first time in its entirety: I started coding and creating mobile apps which would handhold one learning music; I created multiple aspects of the remote-learning management system for my school; I created a NFC based app to exchange contact details; I started creating. I created new music; I created wonky sounds; I co-created a podcast which never got traction; I created workflows that would break my soul as I realized how much more difficult creating anything could be.\\n\\nI created anything and everything: crouched up in my room, hunched over my laptop for as long as 18\u201320 hours a day; that did not matter as I was creating for the very joy of just creating.\\n\\nI started enjoying my time, living in this weird zone of the in-between. There were no pure proper lockdown measures where I was living yet, but a lot of people were still acknowledging the pandemic, and public places were almost entirely devoid of any human presence. Ranging from my balcony, to roaming around in my old high school devoid of any one, I enjoyed my presence in these spaces where I felt like I did not technically belong.\\n\\nI was stuck in multiple transitionary phases of my own life: trying to find my own identity, anxious about my own future, and the future of the world. However, there was a weird feeling of solace when I found myself roaming around the hallways of my old school at 8PM, or a supermarket devoid of 98% of the people, or just looking at the highway from my balcony with zero cars at a time which would be considered rush hour.\\n\\nHuman-built places outside of ones that have any personal meaning (such as your home) are built with an immense level of utilitarian mindset and purpose. Think about it: a school hallway gets its life from the people that surround it during the day. It is the period of time when even you exist in it. To see it in the night-time, devoid of any people and any life, filled with an endless repetition of lockers, classroms, and furniture: what set of events happened that led one person to even be here? And why was this terrifying, yet comforting in a way?\\n\\nAnd then it hit me. I enjoyed existing in a space which was only transitionary in nature: one that is never paid close attention to, or given the amount of respect it deserves. I paid attention to what went un-noticed by everyone else, and at unconventional times, became completely frozen and devoid of life.\\n\\n![Chapter 3](./3.webp)\\n\\nSeptember 2020: I started university as an international student halfway across the world. To manage the time difference, I set my clock to the local time of my university, and then decided to never look outside the window.\\n\\nThis approach, coupled with the already frozen-nature of the pandemic (still at an all-time high) resulted in me solely existing in the in-between. I would be up throughout the night, and sleep during the day.\\n\\nThis would mean no outside world contact, very limited contact with my family that\u2019d be sleeping while I was awake (and vice versa), and existing in a state of pure loneliness except for when I was on a Zoom call. One moment you\u2019re on this call enjoying a 3 hour game night with friends, the next moment said call has ended and now you\u2019re all alone, in utter silence, transitioning to your next call of the night.\\n\\nIt was during this time that I started experimenting with documenting the feeling that I\u2019d get whenever I was existing in these transitional spaces: ranging from empty school hallway, to hotel rooms that I had to stay in during pandemic-related travelling, to even the feeling of dread when I was done with a phone call and had no one to speak to.\\n\\nIt was during this time, that YouTube recommended me to this particular video, which did a great job of conveying what I was trying to capture far better than anything I had done myself (courtesy of YouTuber [MiacDaled](https://youtu.be/KJfew0PXSAk?si=U-KR6g7Pb_ujYWpY)):\\n\\n<iframe width=\\"560\\" height=\\"315\\" src=\\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJfew0PXSAk?si=M6kc7U88Hoqf0ZCE\\" title=\\"YouTube video player\\" frameborder=\\"0\\" allow=\\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share\\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\\n\\nI was unknowingly appreciating [Liminal Spaces](https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Liminal_Space): an aesthetic that portrays empty spaces which are given meaning only through the existence of people in it. While in technical terms the word \u201climinal\u201d refers to a transition, thus making \u201climinal spaces\u201d places that help you transition from one point to another, it is a bit more than that.\\n\\nLiminal Spaces have this tendency to evoke emotions of nostalgia, yet reside in the uncanny valley for almost everyone, regardless of your specific background. They feel familiar, yet are distorted just enough for one to not feel entirely at home.\\n\\n![Weinstein](./4.webp)\\n\\nBy being stripped of its essential context, for example, the auditorium above may evoke a sense of unease. You have never been here before, yet you have memories of being in an auditorium like the one above. You know the feeling of those spring-seats, the texture of the carpet, and the feedback noise of the microphone. You expect to see people, and hear them chattering. Yet, here you\u2019re presented the same space, at a state that you are not expected to have visited it. The question is not why is no one here, the question is why are you here?\\n\\nThe more you roam in this space, stripped of its context, the more you are paying attention to details that went un-noticed at first. You are forced to take in details of the seats, the carpets, the ceiling beams\u2026you cannot focus on anyone, since there is not anyone there. Your fear does not stem from anticipating the presence of anyone else, it stems from anticipating why are you existing in this space.\\n\\nYet, despite the uneasiness, they evoke a sense of familiarity and belonging. There are aspects of this room that all of us have experienced: physical and emotional. Distortions, no-context anxiety, yet familiarity of such spaces evoke emotions of nostalgic dread that a lot of us have simply not felt: only because you are forced to really take-into what you had taken for-granted.\\n\\n![Chapter 4](./5.webp)\\n\\nThere is a reason why this term was coined in 2020: the world was in itself a Liminal Space at the time of the pandemic. It was noticed in a way it was never supposed to be noticed, with lockdown mandates essentially forcing everyone to exist in the transitionary state, waiting for anything to happen. Public spaces that had been given purpose were meaningless, and the deathday looming coupled with the period of not having any medical cures or vaccines led to everyone existing in an emotional liminal space of their own.\\n\\nAs an aesthetic, Liminal Spaces are heavy into using imagery from the 2000s and 1990s, trying to reach out to a time that has long gone by, created by people before us who had experiences that we will never be able to experience ourselves. Yet, in these unreachable experiences, are interlaced our own that we are very familiar with, yet choose to never introspect upon.\\n\\nIn this [video](https://youtu.be/olsXUqKTWgI?si=EIaPEywX853EmMYF), YouTuber Cresendex does a deep analysis of the entire aesthetic, and why it speaks to them. They point out three major aspects of what makes a Liminal Space evoke undiscovered emotions: a transitory nature, a sense of nostalgia, and a dream-like uncanniness. There had not been a time before this pandemic, to experience these three aspects interwoven into daily-lives in a way that was almost forced down upon one, as opposed to them actively seeking out these experiences.\\n\\nTo really try and give a sense of what I am trying to convey, here is my all-time favourite Liminal Space rendition:\\n\\n![Reddit](./6.webp)\\n\\nImage Credits: [u/Moistwee on](https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/oncbrk/petrol_station_after_a_good_downpour/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&utm_content=3&utm_term=22) [r/LiminalSpaces](https://reddit.com/r/LiminalSpaces)\\n\\nI have memories of coming back from long road trips when I was a child, half-sleepy and tired from the long car ride. I remember stargazing, resting my head on the vibrating window of the car, being slightly hungry and uneasy, up well past my bedtime in the middle of nowhere. A gas station stop, with its smells and subpar food felt almost heavenly after being trapped in a car for 6 hours or such. Trying to look at the time on my digital watch with the help of the passing streetlights, looking at other vehicles momentarily as they pass us\u2026I have recollections of entire memories about this image which is not even taken by me.\\n\\nI would highly recommend Cresendex\u2019s video above, which dives into more forms of Liminal Spaces which I have not covered here, yet resonate to.\\n\\n![Chapter 5](./7.webp)\\n\\nIn the context of my own life, liminal spaces have become one of these cherished treasures that I keep going out of my way to experience over and over again. It has become my own medium of exploring my feelings and emotions, and has made me appreciate the powerful nature of being alone.\\n\\nWe have a tendency to get caught up with so many things that happen around us, that even classes and retreats that force us to be alone and meditate are not truly alone in nature. They serve a purpose, and still have people around them.\\n\\nTo truly grasp the value of nothingness is the catalyst to realize the value of yourself. Liminal Spaces are beautiful because they have a purpose, but only during a specific time and context. Outside of them, they have nothing: no activity, no value, and no purpose. We attribute these places to our own nostalgia, since we have all been to places as such, but to see them out of context can lead us to a journey that maybe helps us find our own self worth.\\n\\nLet us appreciate the value of spaces which are given value because of us, and take a moment to introspect these spaces, and by extension introspect our own selves.\\n\\nLastly, I would suggest everyone to play 2:22AM, to experience what I have been trying to say. I promise, you will not regret it. It is not horror. Thank Cresendex for the recommendation.\\n\\nUntil next time.\\n\\n![End](./8.jpg)\\n\\n<hr />\\n\\nAll pictures have been taken by me, except where mentioned.
