# GitHub Bots: Stop Doing This

One of the more infuriariting things I have come across on the GitHub platform is people using bots to mass follow other people, in hopes for a follow back (or more importantly, some stars and forks on their projects). 

However, when unreciprocated with a follow and some stars, their main goal is to unfollow and refollow, thus coming on the top of my timeline again. 

They keep this up for a very long period of times, sometimes almost thrice a week for 2 months.

I am done with this stuff, and obviously GitHub's reporting button does not do anything much.
