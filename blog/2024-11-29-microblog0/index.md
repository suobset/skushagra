# New Tag: Microblog

A tag to collect short blog posts that document something trivial, or things that are not needed to be well-written or long. Think of a Twitter/Threads replacement, minus the interactions (which I will miss and not miss at the same time, depending on who I was talking to).

<!-- truncate -->

The format of these posts will be microblog on display when you are scrolling through all blog entries, and rest of the info hidden like this under the ```Read More``` button (which you just hit to read this very sentence).

If there is no need for more info, there exists no ```Read More``` button.

I mentioned a couple of posts ago that I have quit social media, or at least am taking a hiatus from the same. The biggest one I miss is Threads, where I was able to build a humble collection of followers who were some of the best people to debate and converse with.

The problem became where I received tons of trolls and self-righteous people. At one point, the constant checking of my notifications and fending off these replies became way too much. The worst was where any opinion attracted the people on the opposite spectrum, as if the algorithm knew that would generate engagement. 

Would I miss interactions with other genuine people by microblogging on here? Yes, most definitely.

Will this tag give me a low-stakes environment to document things that are not too deep or need to be long and well-written?? Yes.

Was this inspired by [John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net)?? Yes.
