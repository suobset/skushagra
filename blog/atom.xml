        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A tag to collect short blog posts that document something trivial, or things that are not needed to be well-written or long. Think of a Twitter/Threads replacement, minus the interactions (which I will miss and not miss at the same time, depending on who I was talking to).</p><p>The format of these posts will be microblog on display when you are scrolling through all blog entries, and rest of the info hidden like this under the <code>Read More</code> button (which you just hit to read this very sentence).</p><p>If there is no need for more info, there exists no <code>Read More</code> button.</p><p>I mentioned a couple of posts ago that I have quit social media, or at least am taking a hiatus from the same. The biggest one I miss is Threads, where I was able to build a humble collection of followers who were some of the best people to debate and converse with.</p><p>The problem became where I received tons of trolls and self-righteous people. At one point, the constant checking of my notifications and fending off these replies became way too much. The worst was where any opinion attracted the people on the opposite spectrum, as if the algorithm knew that would generate engagement. </p><p>Would I miss interactions with other genuine people by microblogging on here? Yes, most definitely.</p><p>Will this tag give me a low-stakes environment to document things that are not too deep or need to be long and well-written?? Yes.</p><p>Was this inspired by <a href="https://daringfireball.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">John Gruber</a>?? Yes.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the more infuriariting things I have come across on the GitHub platform is people using bots to mass follow other people, in hopes for a follow back (or more importantly, some stars and forks on their projects). </p><p>However, when unreciprocated with a follow and some stars, their main goal is to unfollow and refollow, thus coming on the top of my timeline again. </p><p>They keep this up for a very long period of times, sometimes almost thrice a week for 2 months.</p><p>I am done with this stuff, and obviously GitHub's reporting button does not do anything much. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot 1" src="/assets/images/sc1-f7af20d35009b77900177a93775d90dc.png" width="1818" height="1106" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot 2" src="/assets/images/sc2-96d8b0dfe14a94e7012acbe9d5f2f101.png" width="1884" height="1522" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot 3" src="/assets/images/sc3-b345df77cc2bb088e557d929942ed087.png" width="1800" height="824" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Screenshot 4" src="/assets/images/sc4-0c426fc84402b21f170e515833b37ef9.png" width="1866" height="1654" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>None of these accounts have much meaningful contributions to anything, outside of copy and pasted Leetcode solutions. Seriously, that is all. Between templates for generic web dev projects, Leetcode solutions, and profile readmes that read like you entered a rave in Ibiza, I have not found anything substantial. And these generic repos (which all of them have a version of) have a good amount of stars, from each other. </p><p>Fun.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Go out and create something. Put time and effort into it. Sometimes, you may find yourself to be in a rut that is difficult to come out of. But, do create something and put your soul and effort into it.</p><p>We are finally in a weird late stage capitialism point wherein we have successfully monetized everything, on a rolling basis. Mediocre products are sold at exorbitant pricing, and even our sanity and emotions are being taken away from us. Social media has monetized being famous, and gives an equal voice to everyone regardless of their qualifications or backgrounds. Your value is only based on ephemeral metrics and numbers, and the joy of creating has become transformed into a dread of meeting deadlines that fulfill sponsorship contracts. </p><p>I have felt that the world has become actively hostile to the very idea of spending time and effort into a craft, and our attention spans + emotions have become increasingly points of monetary benefit for tons of companies around. There are a couple of experiences I would like to mention here.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ai-tools-for-writing-and-art">AI Tools for Writing and Art<a href="#ai-tools-for-writing-and-art" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to AI Tools for Writing and Art" title="Direct link to AI Tools for Writing and Art">​</a></h2><p>Now, I'll be real. I will not sit here and pretend that writing an email to defer your presentation from this week to the next is some bastion of human creativity or adds anything much in our lives. In all honesty, most AI writing tools probably help all of us make our work more streamlines and a bit faster. </p><p>But I am seeing an increasing sentiment of people trying to replace human creativity, with the argument of how much more difficult the barrier of entry to creativity and expression used to be. Upon further expanding. most arguments delve into some form of aversion to the difficulties of sitting down to think of ideas, or going through multiple periods of writer's block. People fail to realize that the struggle, effort, and ideas put by real people is what makes art touching.</p><p>"Oh, AI art is getting there and it's soon going to get more human and emotional.", no it probably is not. There are logical fallacies to this argument. Firstly, AI cannot create anything new on it's own. It is solely trained on whatever texts have already existed, and it cannot just come up with new things on the fly. You need human experiences and input to create something new, out of the box.</p><p>Two: you genuinely have the wrong ideas if you believe art should be done for monetization purposes. I agree that getting paid for your craft is every artist's dream, but even above that lies a love for storytelling, documenting, and interacting with people that you have never met through all sorts of mediums.</p><p>Digital mediums have definitely democratized art and creation to a huge extent. Even what I am writing right now is much easier thanks to my Mac, BBEdit, Docusaurus, and GitHub Pages. You do not need a whole studio to create music or edit videos anymore, and anyone can blow up on YouTube. But at one point, if you are just telling the computer what to make, and the computer makes it for you: you are not creating art. You just had an idea, and you did not put a single ounce of effort or time into it. </p><p>Do you expect people to put in effort to consume media that the producer put zero efforts, emotions, thoughts, or humanity into?</p><p>Personally, I use AI tools for my work to an extent. But at most, they make me more efficient writing a quick email or getting code boilerplate. For creative work, the output of AI is so awful. And not in a "this human looks distorted" way. No matter how good stable diffusion gets, it will never be able to replace human touch. </p><p>We were supposed to create digital tools to expedite our boring day-to-day jobs, so that we could create more music, literature, paintings, movies, and collectively raise our creative output. You know, the crux of the human experience, experiencing feelings and finding universal connection.</p><p>We already have AI that does the former. Let's focus on that. Why are we trying for it to create music or videos? Seriously, if you just had an idea, and you input that on a computer: you are not improving as an artist (let alone be considered one). The journey to art is supposed to have blocks. That is what forces you to think out of the box, and really put who you are in it. Otherwise, it is devoid of expression. </p><p>Where did we go wrong?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="on-social-media">On Social Media<a href="#on-social-media" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to On Social Media" title="Direct link to On Social Media">​</a></h2><p>I am quitting it. It has far outlived it's utility timespan of connecting people together, and for the most part it is not just a circlejerkfest of people trying to personally attack one another and gain the upper hand. </p><p>This is not just reflected in politics. I, for a while, stopped writing in here and started treating Threads as my outlet for "writing on the Internet purposes". I mainly focused on my niche for Operating Systems, Programming Languages, and new and emerging technology. </p><p>And despite that, the amount of keyboard warriors I had to deal with was absolutely insane. It turns out, people do not care for your opinions all too much. Rather, what is more important is disagreements, even if there is none to begin with. It is important to disagree and try to play "devil's advocate", or one up the person, even if the post being made is something so simple as "I like that the new Mac can charge off a 20W phone charger". </p><p>My entire time on Threads, except for the 5 or so people who I genuinely loved interacting with, was mainly filled with people trying to disagree with me on my takes (ok fine) and then personally attacking me for not thinking correctly (not fine). I even did experiments:</p><ul><li>Positive post on Apple: I am an Apple sheep</li><li>Negative post on Apple: I do not know what I am talking about</li><li>Small clarification on kernel dev: I am a novice who knows nothing about kernel dev</li><li>Small question on kernel dev: I am an expert (links post above) so I should already know this</li><li>Shitpost: ok fine this does well regardless</li></ul><p>Again, I genuinely loved my time on Threads. But most posts would do average numbers (like a couple thousands), and then any time I had an opinion on anything, it would do millions (with keyboard warriors personally attacking me and my knowledge in the comments section). I essentially had all notifications turned off on Threads.</p><p>I met some really cool people on the platform, and had some genuinely insightful conversations. If they're reading this, they know who they are. But for the most of it, the keyboard warriors were insane, and the algorithm would only push posts that had content aligned in a way for said warriors to engage. Some of my Threads have millions of views. They are also the ones where I have engaged the least. </p><p>So it sucks, but I am back to writing long form content to save my mental sanity, and just write for the love of writing.</p>]]></content>

I think the weirdest part to grasp, personally, was the new and unknown environment. </p><p>I have been inducted into iCons, have come out of my academic issues in certain course, and am finally starting to get a hold of things. I came to the US by myself, had a family friend help me get from New Jersey to Amherst, and got into quarantine in an empty apartment. Since I was an international student coming in during the global pandemic, my first exposure ever to is new environment was even more isolation. </p><p>It was good and bad, in it's own right. I believe that the good was getting mental peace3. I had been up on my own, and was in a perpetual 1 year isolation prior to this, so it wasn't the isolation bit of it that i had to get used to, as much as it was the 1) getting my sleep schedule to be at night again, and 2) feeling comfortable.</p><p>And that second point is the big one. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="on-feeling-comfortable">On feeling comfortable<a href="#on-feeling-comfortable" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to On feeling comfortable" title="Direct link to On feeling comfortable">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Instagram stories from the apartment" src="/assets/images/nl72-1a74027c4dfd56ea495514d3a08e8410.png" width="2836" height="1175" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>You see, Amherst is a small town. But UMass is not (by a longshot), and it genuinely frightened me a little bit coming in here as a Sophomore. I was genuinely nervous about being able to make friends, or finding that niche. </p><p>For about 14 days, I was in this apartment pictured above, with no furiture or anything. Food was boxed from the UMass Dining folks, and I would just stay alone in the room. After this period, however, I moved into my room at OHill. And that was terrible, in it's own way. </p><p>For one: UMass did not provide much help in me moving in. They just, kind of, left me on my own to drag my suitcases up the hill and into my room. Ok fine, was an ordeal but not too bad. The moment after I went in my room, I walked to Whitmore to get my ID. Not knowing any of the bus routes and stuff, walking through the entire path made me feel even more lonely. The isolatiopn I had felt for so long met with constant people my age around me: a complete shift in how I had lived life for about a year or so now. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="OHill Room" src="/assets/images/nl73-c0efefb8403e53f0567154ecc64283de.jpg" width="3264" height="1468" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Secondly, not too many professors were accomodating in me being able to attend coursework. Missing the first 2 weeks, especially in a STEM degree, just meant I kept playing catch-up for the rest of the semester. I had my first midtern 5 days after I got out (and being able to only attend 2 classes for that course), and I bombed it. The rest of the semester was just playing catch-up for the most of it. Fun times. </p><p>I did soon get more comfortable with peolpe around me. My roommate and I never truly bonded over on much, we both did play Video Games as a hobby but preferred wildly differengt genres. I still liked living with him, fun times. </p><p>The other big benefit that living at OHill bought was the fact that a lot of people I knew lived here as well!! Made it super easy to follow up on projects, socialize, and have fun!! Each floor had a common room, and I genuinely appreciated having such a great community. </p><p>I was mainly nervous thinking that I'd not find a lot of friends, but UMass is genuinely such a vibrant community that was extremely welcoming. Being a big university actually worked more in my favor than less. You can find whatever niche you love. </p><p>That's programming and lightsaber battles for me. And <a href="/docs/independent/saberstat">I found that niche so easily.</a></p><p>I made some more friends as I went by. I met Nhi, Krishna, Frank, James, Justin, Ibrahima, Carter, and Rachel: all close frienjds of mine even today. The bad was mostly surrounding academics, when it came to socializing &amp; trying to find my niche (the thing I was more worried about), I had an upwards trajectory for once in my life (after the pandemic)!!</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hackumass-9-cics">HackUMass 9, CICS<a href="#hackumass-9-cics" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to HackUMass 9, CICS" title="Direct link to HackUMass 9, CICS">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="CICS Discord Meetup" src="/assets/images/nl74-1b417eaf9bc6f88989da4111bdaeb5f2.png" width="1216" height="1128" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>So, blazing through some highlights here:</p><ul><li>I met up with a lot of people in the CICS Discord and became friends</li><li>I created <a href="/docs/undergraduate/moodmusic">MoodMusic</a> in hackUMass 9.</li><li>I joined the Student Alumni Association.

We got our shirts, saw each other in real life for the first time, and generally had a great vibe. This weas also the semester that i was still moving around different social groups and trying to find a fotting as to what it was that I wanted to do, so things were not too solidified yet. As mentioned above, I went to UMass Pitch, and to the SAA. Never truly found myself at home at either of these places, but I persisted. </p><p>It was the Spring semester that bought more things into place, with the advent of my first iCons class. I teamed up with Jack, Yi, Gabby, Cleo to create a through analysis of the <a href="/docs/undergraduate/iconsMoS">Boston T System</a>. This project was sponsored by the Museum of Science, and went on to be one of the best iCons experiences I have had. We hung out in Boston, made videos, talked at the Museum of Science, I was even invited to give a talk on this project at MIT about half a year later!! </p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lu-qJayZEmE?si=RPO5K_8e4EOjxeio" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe><p>I also found Seb, Anvitha, Frank through iCons. It felt good to have a social circle that solidified more. iCons became the primary social circle I had in UMass, and stayed that way till the end. </p><p>This was, still, the second best thing to happen that year.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="iCons 2" src="/assets/images/nl76-a6954b30ec979a94ba856407cb6ae383.png" width="1214" height="922" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="rose">Rose<a href="#rose" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Rose" title="Direct link to Rose">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Rose" src="/assets/images/nl720-43ea999be4ed9c9141fa6144a6cd73e4.JPG" width="2049" height="1536" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Genuinely, the best thing to happen this year was on November 21, 2021, when I met my long term partner Rose. It's a bit funny in retrospect how I found my partner while going through a period of time when I was uncertain about being able to make any friends, but it was amazing in it's own way. </p><p>Rose and I met at Smith College, and started dating at about December of that year. I met her parents, and bought her to a vacation in India next year. We moved in together the next year as well, and continue to share an apartment in Boston, MA. </p><p>I don't say much about her usually, but I am genuinely amazingly grateful to have her in my life. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="personal-developments">Personal Developments<a href="#personal-developments" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Personal Developments" title="Direct link to Personal Developments">​</a></h2><p>So at the end of the day, I needed a re-calibration in academia; mostly just during the Fall semester. I was able to regain academic performance the semester after. I met my long-term partner, and officially met everyone in iCons and started being closer with them. </p><p>At the same time, I tried out the Student Alumni Association &amp; UMass Pitch, both groups that I genuinely loved beign a part of, but both groups that i had to leave due to personal life stuff. Most of my time went into the iCons social circle (especially as iCons in itself was a program that funded student ideas and innovation). </p><p>Creatively, September 2021 to May 2022 did not have any output. Was I having writer's block?? Maybe. </p><p>For the longest time, I had stayed inside and captured the trapedness of indoor life. If a photo opportunity mimicking similar constraints presented itself, I went for it. But all in all, I did not feel creatively motivated at all.</p><p>Maybe it was due to the fact that the liminality aesthetic, which had become the cornerstone of my self-expression, was only applicable during a time of staying inside, and having the feelings of loneliness. However, this year was different. This was more of a "trying to find my identity in a new environment, and my social circle" YEAR, i BELIEVE.</p><p>In my personal life, I have only been able to create art at a time when I have known how I feel, and what contexual clues and references from my life are shaping up what my state is. </p><p>After I met Rose, and after the Spring semester of having worked with iCons &amp; being entrenched in that program: I took up photography, properly. I had been using my phone so far to create artwork and capture images, but I moved on to first using more professional tooling (actual image editors, concepts from photograpghy, and Chromatica: a professional manual control camera app). </p><p>At first, most of my pictures were, I'd say, a little generic. I was mainly trying to figure out landscape photography, as well as get a hang of my editing suite. Nevertheless, these are some of my first pictures. While they may not identify with a given aesthetic too much, there are still some inspirations I have taken from some aesthetic stuff.</p><p>If I did find myself in an aesthetic that I identified with, I did capture that. But, this is just to say, i also captured a lot of generic stuff in an effort to learn.</p><p>I am still proud of these pictures. I had been into photography for a long time, but these were some of the first that I had properly learnt photography for, focused on some theoritical aspects, and learnt to edit &amp; create in a more streamlined manner. I went from just shadows &amp; highlighting &amp; filters to full blown color correction, levels &amp; curve adjusting, and proper workflows that I have refined on ever since. </p><p>Currently, my photography has become an all-around self-expression: refining on these workflows above while incorporating different goals, aesthetics, and conditions. But that's for a different time. Currently, I am just proud looking back at my pictures, and I hope you enjoy them too, even if they are a bit more on the generic side at times :)</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Smith College: Campus Pond" src="/assets/images/nl78-687ead81930e8d661a9dd57464208bfc.JPG" width="2049" height="1537" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Smith College: Campus Pond</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="UMass OHill Parking spots: a liminal space that I captured" src="/assets/images/nl79-f0a039eb10130a4e7cdcf2b6f82755fe.png" width="4032" height="3024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>UMass OHill Parking spots: a liminal space that I captured</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Smith College Campus Pond" src="/assets/images/nl711-60fd838545be43034ed4b6a33cb220b0.JPG" width="2049" height="1537" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Smith College Campus Pond</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="San Francisco, I loved film photography, especially it&amp;#39;s influence in a lot of aesthetics like Vaporwave" src="/assets/images/nl712-38325aa15e4ad7139c31ab10ef42a119.jpg" width="4032" height="3024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>San Francisco, I loved film photography, especially it's influence in a lot of aesthetics like Vaporwave</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Central Park, NYC" src="/assets/images/nl713-f3a2e89acc4b5fff339bc5f5a6c44aa6.png" width="4032" height="2268" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Central Park, NYC</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Golden Gate Bridge" src="/assets/images/nl714-3a89fbfd2c3dbc23a1544ca69a3dc73b.png" width="2731" height="1536" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Golden Gate Bridge</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="On the Golden Gate Bridge" src="/assets/images/nl715-f6a95986a260fe3041136443a5151214.png" width="2730" height="1536" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On the Golden Gate Bridge</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Uttrakhand, India" src="/assets/images/nl716-97db990f352fdee429c0878e8a6e0f61.png" width="3024" height="4032" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Uttrakhand, India</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Uttrakhand, India" src="/assets/images/nl718-c9536978bfc7ee717b7d131f8b7ed9bd.png" width="4032" height="3024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Uttrakhand, India</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tldr">Tl;Dr<a href="#tldr" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tl;Dr" title="Direct link to Tl;Dr">​</a></h2><p>Met a lot of friends, got my social circle footing, did amazing work with Museum of Science and with embedded systems, met Rose, got into photography properly.</p>]]></content>

I think for this newsletter, I'd like to take a step back and recount some good memories, what I learnt, and what I want to take forward in life as a UMass Amherst Alum.</p><p>UMass Amherst provided me with a ton of opportunities, and an incredible social circle. It was a very transformative journey for me personally, despite the shortcomings and such. As I sit here after 4 years, I cannot help but think of so many ways that the people in this University have shaped me to who I am today, and I wanted to dedicate this post to remembering some of those experiences and people. </p><p>I will divide this blog post in terms of the years at UMass, as well as opportunities. For the most of it, I am making this as we go...so we'll see how it goes. I think it is also worthwhile to mention how this is my second attempt at a reflection: my first being a personal document I wrote for my own purposes, reflecting on every class I have taken at UMass and my takeaways. That one's personal, and for my own records. This one is a bit more overarching, and consists of things that were more personal in nature. </p><p>This is the story of my personal UMass journey, not my academic journey. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="freshman-its-going-to-be-a-long-night">Freshman: It's going to be a long night<a href="#freshman-its-going-to-be-a-long-night" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Freshman: It's going to be a long night" title="Direct link to Freshman: It's going to be a long night">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Zoom Meeting for a Fall 2020 Class" src="/assets/images/n6i3crop-1607cd8d4e1e8a04caa8da7f0f2941ea.png" width="1172" height="864" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We started off weird, huh? At this point it feels that even pointing out COVID has become like beating a dead horse, but it was quite the influential time. I have a weird lens to remember this time, from weird grudges to abysmally awkward time schedules: this was a hard one.</p><p>Picture this: you're on a group study session for about 3-4 hours now (more realistically, this is a mix of half friendly sessions and half serious study). It's a Discord call, with about 8-12 people present. We all help each other with our coding assignments, and we talk to each other and get to know each other as well. Some of the best people I knew came in from here: Ibrahima, Varshini, Carter, James, Stefanie, and many others. After many hours, though, everyone is kind of tired; and we all want to continue for the rest of our day. We have been on this call since 9AM EST, and it's almost 4PM EST. </p><p>Except I am in Dubai as we speak (and later India). It's not EST for me, in fact quite the opposite. The moment I hit that "End Call" button, I am left alone with my thoughts at the middle of night. It's 3AM, I cannot sleep because I have been functioning on Eastern Standard Time throughout (I closed every window, set my watch to EST, and almost never looked outside).</p><p>Which also meant that my family was awake while I was asleep, and vice versa. Even though we lived in the same house, I barely talked to them (almost if at all). The brief periods we were both awake at the same time was cherished a lot, but for the most of it I had meals alone and spent time in my room alone. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Midnight Code" src="/assets/images/fcomp-a39d0ccbb822d5af6d4687d1032ed65a.png" width="1318" height="1406" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This isn't to say that I completely hated this time. It was the only time I was completely alone with my thoughts, and I feel that this may have been the only time to have provided me this specific circumstance. Almost my entire love for the Liminal Space aesthetic comes from this time period, as well as the thrill of getting into deep lores for different art works (Regional at Best, The Backrooms, and all sorts of Internet Exploration). It felt nice being alone with my thoughts, figuring out what I really wanted to be. It seems apt that this is when I found Internet Communities, aesthetics that work with how I perceive the world, obscure music, and tons of Internet friends. </p><p>Notably, this is when I decided to post on the <code>r/penpals</code> subreddit, looking for a closer Internet friend to share notes and letters with. I got to know Fania, who still remains a very close friend (both Rose and I know her at this point). Fania and I talked through multiple phases of our university lives: even though we sometimes went off thanks to university life being difficult, we always remained close friends to this day. </p><p>For me personally, it was the second half of Freshman year that became more difficult, even though it had more positive things to present. While dealing with COVID trauma and some losses in our family, I also had to navigate the perils of being falsely accused of Academic Dishonesty (it was a Gradescope error). While I was able to make a case for myself and come out of that situation, it was one of the most stressful things I have ever been in. I remember going without sleep for almost the whole week and a half: in between taking care of my sister and managing everything in the house as the sole "adult" while my family were tending to emergencies for other family members. I felt drained and tired and alone. I made a case for myself, got up, and continued. Eventually, I was able to make a compelling case and things got resolved. I passed the class, everything continued to being great. It was just too much to take in all at once at the time, however. </p><p>I remember waking up in an exceptionally chilled room, seeing my laptop on the table and the sunrise outside. Freshman year was the worst in many cases, but I have the clearest memories of the time, plus the experiences were something that I required to undergo this metamorphosis into who I am today. </p><p>This is the sunrise on the day of me resolving that issue, also moments before I got the news of my grandfather's passing. All in the week and half. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Sunrise" src="/assets/images/sunrise-849e5296eec172ebee76e1d30dbef74c.jpg" width="4000" height="3000" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Here is the amazing that happened around a week after all of this, though: the biggest (and far exceeding anything else) achievement was the fact that I was inducted into iCons after a rigorous application &amp; interview process, and was inducted into the Honors college prior to that. As was everything else at the time, we got inducted online!! </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="iCons Pledge" src="/assets/images/iconsPledge-c838eaaa3266f0d41b3ec9ef167fc4b0.png" width="971" height="694" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now, in hindsight while I can say that iCons is my primary UMass social circle, and also the platform to some of the best work I have done as my time here: I really had absolutely no clue how big of a thing it would be back then. We started with iCons 1 in this semester, and I made a pretty cool website to demo our data in an interactive manner alongside our poster. Terrible UI/UX, but impressive research for a group of people who had never done it before (<a href="https://skushagra.com/docs/undergraduate/hydrogenBatteries" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">archived here</a>). The idea of giving people an interactive method of playing around with our data as opposed to looking at inanimate graphs on a poster stuck. I have since made a website for every single iCons project, without fail. </p><p>Oh, and I helped organize the whole class into coming up with our name and logo. This was the design after a long voting process (s/o Anvitha):</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Apollo 11 iCons" src="/assets/images/apollo11-eab22ef5b0ccac051f5c21fc63f07116.jpg" width="1024" height="1024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Honorary alternate logos at the end :')</p><p>Every single close friend I have going out of this university are iCons friends, with a few exceptions of close friends from other avenues. I have enjoyed working with all of them so much, and I continue to work with some of them in some capacity. iCons gave me my social circle; and it is honestly great to have found other semi-introverted nerdy friends to hang out with. </p><p>Another fun thing I did was to pull 3 all nighters in a row for <a href="https://hackumass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HackUMass VII</a> to create my first ever mobile app (I had done cloud computing and client web dev beforehand). We created <a href="https://skushagra.com/docs/undergraduate/dermsafe" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DermSafe</a>: a computer vision app that can detect skin cancer from a picture. Good implementation, trash design. I did learn that I could pull myself much more than I could anticipate. And I did, ever since.  </p><p>I took a lot of "liminal" pictures during these time. Yes, they are heavily edited and saturated, but I was trying to grasp this aesthetic and find my tone more. I was taking influences from Vaporwave, Outrun, Liminal Spaces, and Dreamcore (huge overlaps but they are also different in their own ways). Essentially, a feeling of eerieness stemming from being alone coupled with some nostalgia (or tapping into emotions you didn't know you felt).</p><p>The awfully chilly room in the morning of me resolving the academic issue:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Morning Room" src="/assets/images/f4-82e78d456f47c2986ddd63dcb63018b1.png" width="1470" height="1458" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Some other pictures:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Road Trip" src="/assets/images/f1-2da62c192fb8d03a1578540137ba0f7a.png" width="1392" height="1410" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Empty Garden" src="/assets/images/f2-619f5f0bbfa37cd750049f20891d80cf.png" width="1466" height="1460" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Empty Playground" src="/assets/images/f3-e747f32272ac1793bd864a957fc3376b.png" width="1456" height="1438" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I listened to a lot of music that also went hand-in-hand with the aesthetic. I got into midwest emo, very old twenty one pilots lore (RAB, NPI, Level of Concern Demos that referenced old shit), and some Odesza for optimism.</p><p>As of writing and compiling this, I am realizing how much of a role aesthetics have taken into my life as an undergraduate. Funnily enough, this has been a theme throughout my undergraduate; and it still is today (the theming of this website is my own take on combining the eerieness of liminal spaces with the weird comfort that having nostalgic elements give). Maybe I'll write a post on describing what my outlook towards aestehtics are and how I use them to express creativity, but for the purposes of this post I'll stick to university experiences. I have a hunch that the evolution of my interactions with aesthetics will be visible here. </p><p>Here's to part 2 and beyond for the rest of my university experiences (no more than 4 parts), I just need the time to collate media &amp; my thoughts. Fun stuff. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="honorary-notes">Honorary Notes<a href="#honorary-notes" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Honorary Notes" title="Direct link to Honorary Notes">​</a></h2><p>Footnotes, I guess.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="alternate-icons-logos">Alternate iCons logos:<a href="#alternate-icons-logos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Alternate iCons logos:" title="Direct link to Alternate iCons logos:">​</a></h3><ol><li><img loading="lazy" alt="Apollo 11 alt" src="/assets/images/apollo11Alt-247a54efd65c5714fcb47cf4b9019861.jpeg" width="1573" height="1000" class="img_ev3q"></li><li><img loading="lazy" alt="RX11 Logo" src="/assets/images/KDh30jc-b1d6f2f0c0ea756ecb1332625bd0ef58.jpg" width="588" height="679" class="img_ev3q"></li></ol>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Vintage Mac Hello World written on AppleScript]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Vintage Mac Hello World written on AppleScript" src="/assets/images/1-01e6b0cf6ad2f865b4694882b57ffa9b.png" width="1506" height="622" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The following series (which is separate from my newsletter), is going to be a comprehensive deep dive into programming for Mac OS version 9: the ancient pre-UNIX version of the Operating System which barely has much documentation on the Internet today. This post is mainly initialization, I just got the VM working and a pipeline to install 3rd party (old) software :)</p><p>I do not exactly have a plan in mind, but I hope to be able to share the "why", and possibly the "how", in this blog post. I have always been interested in vintage computing, having dabbled with Windows 3.1 in High School for kicks and giggles, to having just completed my Undergraduate Honors Thesis on comparing performance differences between 2 programming languages on the Assembly level. To me, working through the difficulties of programming and figuring out this puzzle is the fun bit in of itself, and what better platform to take than one that shares very little resemblance to any modern OS (Win 9x uses the Windows API which is still used today, and recent macOS is UNIX based). </p><p>In fact, Classic Macintosh Operating Systems do not share any resemblance to UNIX or macOS as it stands today. Released in October 23, 1999, MacOS 9 ran hard with making everything self-contained in the Graphical User Interface. Absurdly so, there is not even a terminal or any way to interface with the system outside of the Graphical System that was shipped with the OS. </p><p>On top of it, I just love Apple's stuff to a great extent. Yes, I support and use Libre Software wherever possible, but my intrigue for tinkering with computers as a subject started from looking at Apple Computers in my childhood. I remember being in middle school with my Windows laptop, unbelievably looking at my friend's MacBook Pro (I didn't even know computers made of metal existed). I bought a Mac when I could, especially knowing the UNIX layer underneath making programming much easier than it needs to be. Heck, outside of my tinkering with Python through middle and high school, it was my awe of what computers could actually be that caught my fascination with the subject matter (I remember seeing this picture of Jobs wondering what this machine was even....again this was middle school so cut me some slack).</p><p>Throughout my life, I have tinkered with Computers. Started off as Python Programming through Middle School, tinkering with C/C++ and modding Win 3.1 in High School (+ web dev and client dev), and now (as mentioned above) completing my thesis in Programming Language Performance (most of which included tinkering). </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Steve Jobs w/ 1984 Mac" src="/assets/images/5-69eb65ea3f6a4540a6b357c51e90945e.jpg" width="1400" height="1050" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Well, I believe I am at a point where I can now start tinkering with older OSes, and want to learn programming and backporting a modern program for this particular OS. </p><p>However, even when I got the OS to work in a Virtual Machine on my M2 MacBook Air (that's 30 years of hardware differences), I noticed that the system was actually very self-contained. It had a Java Runtime Environment shipped with the core OS (for Applets), and AppleScript (shown in banner image above) was a pretty powerful scripting language which does not have much documentation today (for the version shipped with this OS, I know that a more recent AppleScript is still present in current macOS). </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="AppleScript and the built-in Script Editor" src="/assets/images/2-6711e5f010853e4460b469b43023f05f.png" width="2432" height="1956" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I felt that one of the best aspects of this Operating System was how there is a "Help" section built in. I tried some of the Java Applets built in, perused the source code for the same, and tried editing a website as well. All in all, I felt that MacOS 9 is actually very self-contrained and I may be able to learn more of programming for this specific platform based on the guides and help sections already included in the OS itself. </p><p>I currently want to learn programming for this Operating Systems for 2 main reasons, outside of the fun hobby aspect I mentioned above:</p><ol><li>Backport a recent app to this OS as a project, inspired by <a href="https://youtu.be/CTUMNtKQLl8?si=4TbIgIjPpVcz50FG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> from MattKC backporting <code>.net</code> to Win 95. </li><li>Learn more and understand the workings of older Operating Systems, as an Operating Systems person. Older systems had hardware limitations and needed some clever programming to get around...which makes it an excellent project to see some bodging and optimized programming. </li><li>Take on the challenge of learning a programming language and go on this fairly complex journey with very minimal recent documentation available, and take on this challenge. </li></ol><p>Fun bit is how much resources there already are to go on this journey. I found <a href="https://vintageapple.org/macprogramming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this collection of resources</a> to learn more, and also there's an incredible Software Repository thanks to the <a href="https://infinitemac.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Infinite Mac</a> project.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Vintage Apple" src="/assets/images/4-d7873931273152f3cde3ea715534a35d.png" width="1936" height="1436" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Anyways, I will be putting more updates as this journey unfolds. I will record my programming journey and also mention what app I want to either create or backport. Until then, here's some more tinkering on a Website (+ I got external ISOs to load and 3rd party software to install on this VM successfully). </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Qebsite Screenshot" src="/assets/images/3-b89db5ca4aa8b3914ed9e1ca6026f622.png" width="3156" height="1956" class="img_ev3q"></p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Banner Image: 2024 Solar Eclipse Gathering at UMass Amherst]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Banner Image: 2024 Solar Eclipse Gathering at UMass Amherst" src="/assets/images/5banner-8d796a784261e010f77dbb102665a65f.png" width="4032" height="3024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I have decided that writing this newsletter every week was resulting in a content churn, which was essentially me writing a blog post for the sake of writing it. Hence, I am putting down some changes as to how I write this thing: i.e. I would write whenever I have quite a lot to say (in a meaningful way), while also making it such that I write at least once every month. </p><p>Regardless, it's been a month: and naturally I have a lot of things I want to put in here. From almost completing my thesis work to helping create a video game for a friend's thesis (a first for me), I am so excited to be back into writing stuff. Maybe my Tom Scott expectations of a weekly newsletter were too high (then again, the man has a team), but I feel excited to be writing about this stuff again. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="side-projects">Side Projects<a href="#side-projects" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Side Projects" title="Direct link to Side Projects">​</a></h2><p>Ad my own thesis wraps up and I get a bit more time to pursue other avenues, I am trying to get into more side projects as well as start some of my own again. I felt that there needed to be a fine balance between my actual academic work, side projects, and other hobbies altogether (like photography) so that I do not burn myself out doing one thing only. </p><p>However, my mind is also pretty good at coming up with new ideas left and right, without much consideration of if I will be able to pull it through. Which then raises the question: "How many side projects are one too many?"</p><p>I think I have come up with a non-exhaustive list to tackle the problem of resource allocation for projects that do not relate to my academia/career or professional work. This is my approach:</p><ol><li>Come up with an idea.</li><li>Does this idea:<ul><li>Solve an issue a lot of people have/is it for someone else?</li><li>Solve an issue you have?</li><li>Help you learn something new?</li><li>Help you create something that is just interesting?</li></ul></li><li>Take the above as a priority list, and proceed accordingly. </li></ol><p>This is not to say that any of the above criteria are good or bad, but rather become a way to allocate my limited availability of resources (mostly time) into things that help me grow more. Again, this does not apply to academia or career: those avenues get all my attention as required. But whatever time I have remaining after academia/career need to be used wisely, and the above is my approach towards the same.</p><p>Weeding out all my side projects based on the list above result in these big projects that I am doing currently:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tra86-the-llvm-compiler-performance-tracer">Tra86: The LLVM Compiler Performance Tracer<a href="#tra86-the-llvm-compiler-performance-tracer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tra86: The LLVM Compiler Performance Tracer" title="Direct link to Tra86: The LLVM Compiler Performance Tracer">​</a></h3><p>Misleading, as I should not technically consider this a "side project", but as part of my thesis on comparing RUST and C++ Performance Metrics, I developed a whole range of scripts that would take a C++/RUST Project, Compile to Assembly, Assemble to Object File with Debugging Symbols, Link Header Files, Pass to GDB, and Trace Asm Calls as the program executes. After the tracing, it passes the trace output to another script for analyzing CPU performance. </p><p>Currently, this is only C++/RUST based and on the x86 platform. I am expanding this, since I believe that this could be extended for comparisons between any programming languages (or most). I also plan to create a UI for the whole thing allowing others to be able to use and contribute towards this project. </p><p>More details to be noted in my thesis, and at <a href="https://tra86.skushagra.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://tra86.skushagra.com</a>. Genuinely super excited to get this out in the world, this is my magnum opus currently: </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="tra86" src="/assets/images/tra86-a39cece74ab43460e0d365022d035551.png" width="3164" height="1944" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="anna-biondos-low-carbon-concrete-project">Anna Biondo's Low Carbon Concrete Project<a href="#anna-biondos-low-carbon-concrete-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Anna Biondo's Low Carbon Concrete Project" title="Direct link to Anna Biondo's Low Carbon Concrete Project">​</a></h3><p>A first for me: but I (and <a href="https://github.com/anvitha305" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anvitha Ramachandran</a> of iCons) are currently working with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-biondo-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna Biondo</a> (iCons) to create a video game for her Low Carbon Concrete Project. Part of a bigger project posted <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7176237788382515200/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, Anna served as a Project Intern for Boston Society for Architecture and helped create a report that details the obstacles and opportunities for decarbonizing concrete production. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Report Screenshot" src="/assets/images/lcc-51e8af4e6860129d3a34b5230dee052c.png" width="3164" height="1944" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This report can be accessed <a href="https://www.architects.org/news/decarbonizing-concrete-bsa-clf-report-yields-innovative-board-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><p>Part of this bigger project includes Anna's vision of a Video Game that would guide a player through each of these objectives and hurdles. Each player picks one of the many available personalities and goes through a map, with each section pertaining to a specific challenge in the production of low carbon concrete, while also highlighting the opportunities at each point. We're currently discussing Anna's overall vision in implementing this game, and I will be learning video game development to be able to deliver. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Character Composition" src="/assets/images/lccplayers-b8937748059b2c44102992fec23c0380.png" width="2940" height="1944" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>(Screenshot from the BSA LCC Report linked above)</p><p>I will post more updates as we realize more of Anna's vision and bring it to fruition for her project. Temporarily, the video game project is linked under <a href="https://lccumass.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="morbios-the-rust-based-operating-system">MorbiOS: The RUST-Based Operating System<a href="#morbios-the-rust-based-operating-system" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to MorbiOS: The RUST-Based Operating System" title="Direct link to MorbiOS: The RUST-Based Operating System">​</a></h3><p>MorbiOS is a currently under-development RUST-based Operating System that Anvitha and I are developing, half as a joke and half to teach ourselves more in-depth about different Operating System paradigms and how does one even go about creating one. While we both have extensive Systems experience, them having created a <a href="https://github.com/anvitha305/legv8sim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legv8sim</a> for their thesis and me having compared different programming languages on a low-level baseline, we both believe that this project would provide an immense learning opportunity that classes sometimes do not have time for. And above all, this is a hobby: we actually love doing this stuff.</p><p>While there is not much out there: be on the lookout <a href="https://skushagra.com/docs/finechive/morbios" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a> for more updates to the project as they keep on coming. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="life-updates">Life Updates<a href="#life-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Life Updates" title="Direct link to Life Updates">​</a></h2><p>I am nearing graduation, which is a bit wild to think about because my mind refuses to accept the Zoom semester as a real one. Regardless, here's almost everything new that at least I wanna put out there:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2024-eclipse">2024 Eclipse<a href="#2024-eclipse" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2024 Eclipse" title="Direct link to 2024 Eclipse">​</a></h3><p>I saw the 2024 Eclipse at the Metawampe Lawn at UMass Amherst with a bunch of my friends and the UMass Astronomy Department. Here's a video I took :)</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Pbg3e3i-ErQ?si=24bIviEZzZI84Bi7" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="icons-thesis-assert-and-the-end-of-11">iCons: Thesis, ASSERT, and the end of 11.<a href="#icons-thesis-assert-and-the-end-of-11" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to iCons: Thesis, ASSERT, and the end of 11." title="Direct link to iCons: Thesis, ASSERT, and the end of 11.">​</a></h3><p>As a last project stretch under my affiliation with iCons (honestly THE big thing I will miss from UMass), I presented my Honors Thesis at the Massachusetts Undergraduate Researchers' Conference (MassURC). This is the same thing that tra86 is a part of:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="MassURC" src="/assets/images/massurc-2bba9ea56daa4158599fd8c542352455.png" width="3164" height="1944" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>ASSERT has seemed to come to a point of equilibrium, as most people working on it did not get the time to contribute more towards it. However, the whole thing is very Open Source, and people in the future are welcome to contribute towards it at any point :)</p><p>My other iCons projects have been published on the iCons innovation portal as well. In all terms, iCons has been the best journey I have been a part of, and I look at my work under this endeavor as some of my best. It had ups and downs (some projects being stressful beyond belief), but it gave me the biggest edge in research and scientific communication possible. Above all, at the risk of sounding cheesy, it gave me my closest friends, lifechanging opportunities (Museum of Science, U.S. Census, and an upcoming project) and the best network possible.</p><p>All my iCons projects are listed under my website.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-move-to-boston">The Move to Boston<a href="#the-move-to-boston" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Move to Boston" title="Direct link to The Move to Boston">​</a></h3><p>I am moving to Boston to work for Psivant Therapeutics as a Software/Systems Developer Intern. Yes, Grad School did not work out the way I expected it to this application cycle, but I am looking at this as a hidden opportunity that I would have not even imagined to pursue prior. </p><p>My introduction to Psivant was thanks to Prof. Scott Auerbach, and it seems that my skill-set in Systems (tra86 and the rest) are a perfect fit to the work at Psivant (projects like STORMM). I will not delve into it further, but what it essentially means is that I am pursuing the biggest jump in my career possible. </p><p>Facilitating the same, I will be moving to Boston for the duration of the summer. While it is currently an internship, I hope that we're able to find an appropriate career fit and I could continue until the next application cycle (or beyond). Either ways, I am super excited to start working at and contributing to Psivant, and in this move to Boston as well. </p><p>I may also continue to work for LinKaGe Lab at Smith College under my contract, but that will be a very part-time avenue based on the project I am given. </p><p>This was genuinely a career move that was unexpected just a while ago, but has given me an avenue that was completely unimaginable a couple of months ago. I have loved interacting with everyone at Psivant, and the work genuinely feels like something that is the perfect balance between things that I love doing and am good at (systems, code), while also having that factor of learning and growing more (Physics, Chemistry). Most importantly, this is the one avenue where I believe I do not lose my iCons edge: working on a multidisciplinary global problem, contributing my skill set on the table, and learning new things and interacting with people that help me grow exponentially in my career. </p><p>I thank Prof. Auerbach for introducing me to Psivant, and I cannot wait to join the team and start!! </p><p>Apart from ending my academia and finding this amazing avenue, I do not have much updates. I am glad to be back at writing this stuff, and I will probably do more writing here as time goes, albeit just not in a weekly fashion :)</p><p><strong>Update: 28 Apr 2024</strong></p><p>As part of planning my accommodations in Boston, I ended up creating a quick web app: <a href="https://skushagra.com/docs/finechive/aptPoint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Apartment Pointer</a>. Give it a look :)</p><p>Peace &lt;3</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Newsletter 4 Banner | Washington D.C." src="/assets/images/newsletter4fin-eb42fab26e619f30caf3e7ddf7589b93.png" width="4032" height="3024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Slightly late blog update this week, owing mainly to the amounts of midterms and the thesis progress that had to be made last week. However, we are back and kicking: and I hope that I will be able to keep this momentum up next week as well. In today's newsletter, I would love to highlight some fun code I wrote for my Honors Thesis last semester.</p><p>The banner for this newsletter was taken on my trip to Washington D.C. Fall 2023, during the U.S. Census Department's Justice Week Event. I was one of the 6 people who worked on <a href="https://suobset.github.io/assert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASSERT</a>, a GIS Web-App that directs emergency responders (like Eversource, National Grid) to counties that are more vulnerable to energy inequity. A lot of data processing and web development later, we were able to successfully demo our product, which earnwed us a spot on the Census Department's <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/showcase/?year=2023&amp;partner-agency=Department+of+Energy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">website</a>. </p><p>More details on ASSERT can be found in the Research Section of my website <a href="https://skushagra.com/docs/research/ongoing#umass-integrated-concentration-in-sciences-icons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>, though once the project is done forever the location may move to the <a href="https://skushagra.com/docs/research/icons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iCons Page here</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-times-of-uncertainty-and-my-love-for-pygdb">The Times of Uncertainty, and my love for PyGDB<a href="#the-times-of-uncertainty-and-my-love-for-pygdb" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Times of Uncertainty, and my love for PyGDB" title="Direct link to The Times of Uncertainty, and my love for PyGDB">​</a></h2><p>It is during the times of uncertainty that I believe the best things happen. Such was the case for ASSERT mentioned above, and I believe such will be the case for life ahead. I touched upon how I wanted to work in Systems in Grad School in my last post, and so I thought I'd go a little deeper into my biggest formal systems project as of right now: the Honors Thesis. </p><p>The following is not going to be a deep dive into the intricacies of my project, I'd rather have people look out for my formal thesis for that one. However, I do want to pick out a certain aspect of the project, in an effort to hopefully demonstrate my approach towards problem solving. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a href="#background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background">​</a></h2><p>For my thesis, I am trying to compare performance differences between RUST and C++. I go more over the details in the Research -&gt; Ongoing portion of my website, but in a nutshell here's the workflow</p><ul><li>Write the same program on RUST and C++</li><li>Execute and extract the Assembly (on x86 platforms)</li><li>Assemble and run, and trace the assembly's execution</li><li>Analyze trace files</li></ul><p>My big hurdle in the past semester was point 3, the tracing of an Assembly file's run. I wanted to basically capture each Assembly instruction (for jumps and compare), and write them out to a file as they got executed.

After all, the Stack was just a band-aid to solve an issue that was secondary; the execution of this Assembly code was still causing issues with tracing. </p><p>For one, if we were to measure how efficient a programming language was based on tracing their Assembly outputs, it seemed counter-intuitive to edit such Assembly files. </p><p>But secondly, the execution of all these three edits seemed dubious at best. Even if we run the same program with the same inputs, sometimes these prints would work and sometimes they wouldn't. They were not reliable at all, and did not provide an accurate trace. </p><p>So far, here's a list of everything wrong with this method:</p><ul><li>Does not work well<ul><li>Messes up stacks, registers, values of core registers</li><li>Segmentation Fault Minefield</li><li>Needs to uniformly change Asm files through a janky script</li><li>And pray that it executes well</li></ul></li><li>For real life programs with hundreds of files, does not work well<ul><li>Cannot go outside the context of one file</li><li>Can break interoperability</li></ul></li><li>Most importantly, false metrics can be analyzed, since we are adding our own jumps and calls</li></ul><p>It was time to switch my methodology. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-debugging-approach-to-tracing">A Debugging Approach to Tracing<a href="#a-debugging-approach-to-tracing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to A Debugging Approach to Tracing" title="Direct link to A Debugging Approach to Tracing">​</a></h2><p>I went back to the drawing board for a bit. What we want to do is trace a file; we are essentially looking at this Assembly File and seeing it's behaviors across different commands, variables, and the like. </p><p>What I needed, was a debugging approach to tracing. Here's a quick cut to the chase, and a rundown of what I ended up doing. </p><p>My primary debugger for low level systems stuff has been GNU GDB so far, and I am super comfortable with it. By nature, it has a lot of extensible capabilities, owing partly to the amount of time and community surrounding its development. </p><p>Utilizing GNU GDB as our debugging tool, we leverage the 1v1 binary compatibility of LLVM. The x86 assembly generated from LLVM LLC seamlessly integrates with GDB, enabling us to step into each component, make observations, and generate a trace file. By assembling the x86 assembly with the appropriate -g flags, we can then employ GDB to generate a trace, providing valuable insights into the execution process.</p><p>I found PyGDB, a Python Package that acts as an API to GDB and helps us extend the functionality. So here's how everything works at the end:</p><ul><li>Compile each program till the Assembly</li><li>Assemble with GDB flags</li><li>Start GDB, and my own Python program that notices each GDB step and notes down the execution state</li><li>Output this data to a file, and you have a trace :D</li></ul><p>Here's the initial Python Script I had, for Jumps:</p><div class="language-py

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Grayson Hall, Newsletter 3 Image]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Grayson Hall, Newsletter 3 Image" src="/assets/images/newsletter3-0ac96e40bd5147129d85e72af8d757fc.png" width="4032" height="3024" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This newsletter is a special one to me: it is the third week that I am writing something down on this platform without fail, and thus building up the momentum to continue doing the same for a longer period of time. The issues that come with scheduling problems, or a general lack of motivation towards doing something start to dwindle by the time it is the third week of committing to a new habit.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="momentum">Momentum<a href="#momentum" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Momentum" title="Direct link to Momentum">​</a></h2><p>In fact, it has been a  long standing urban myth that any new habit takes about 21 days to form (current research pinpoints that number to be more in the ballpark of 66 days, though the range goes from 18 - 256 days depending on environments). As described by Maxwell Maltz in his book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho-Cybernetics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Psycho Cybernetics</a>, the key to personal success lies in understanding the dynamic interplay between the mind and one's self image. The author's notion is that it takes 21 days to form a habit, stemming from his experience as a Plastic Surgeon wherein it took 21 days for his patients to accustom themselves to their new physical appearances. </p><p>While newer research has disproven on the notion of "21 days", one valid argument that stems from the same is the fact that a consistent momentum towards an activity awakens motivation to continue on the same trajectory. It's why apps like Duolingo have a "streak" function built in, you do not want it to reset to zero. Starting new hobbies, there is an initial inertia that needs to be overcome. Once overcome, the momentum carries you forward.</p><p>I am happy to be slowly getting there. However, this is still a very "we're figuring this out as we move along" type of newsletter. Maybe there's some beauty in it.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="priorities-changes-and-the-dillemma-of-the-current">Priorities, Changes, and the Dillemma of the Current<a href="#priorities-changes-and-the-dillemma-of-the-current" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Priorities, Changes, and the Dillemma of the Current" title="Direct link to Priorities, Changes, and the Dillemma of the Current">​</a></h2><p>Lately, I have been feeling a little more anxious with each passing day due to many reasons. With my Honors Thesis, Undergraduate Career, and Job wrapping up, I await results for my Graduate Admissions. However, I also do believe that opportunities like such provide an excellent opportunity for reflection and appreciation for everything that has been done. </p><p>I will possibly write a different post in the future about things I am actually proud of in my undergraduate career, since my undergrad career is not quite over yet. Currently, I want to take a moment to list down the things that I am actually looking forward to:</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="grad-school-and-how-we-got-here">Grad School, and how we got here<a href="#grad-school-and-how-we-got-here" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grad School, and how we got here" title="Direct link to Grad School, and how we got here">​</a></h3><p>First and foremost, I am looking forward to grad school. No other way of saying it: but the fact that I might be able to get an opportunity to work on the field that I have wanted to join since I was a middle schooler excites me to no end. I think this would be a very good moment to record how I got into this field:</p><p>My foray into Computer Science stemmed from a love of tinkering with them in middle school, starting from my first computer:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="First Computer" src="/assets/images/logo-14feedf2e515ff56e41afd77517e1e87.png" width="1080" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This beauty ran Windows XP (Win 95 in the above screenshot) with half a gig of DDR2 RAM, 64GB storage, and an Intel Atom processor that was slower than a Lada. However, it being slow was a virtue; given Windows ran like absolute garbage on it, I was compelled to find methods to tinker with and get the most out of this laptop. </p><p>I Googled "alternatives to Windows" as a 7th grade kid, and installed Ubuntu on this computer (thinking what could possibly go wrong). Well, to my surprise, nothing really did go wrong (a lesson I learnt in the future that it was almost miraculous for nothing to go wrong with Linux installs, especially on lesser-known hardware). Ubuntu became my first foray into the world of Linux and Bash scripting (not much you could do on Linux by just relying on the GUI tools). </p><p>This trend continued when I got my first proper computer, an HP laptop which was slow due to Windows 10's bad resource management and it running on a HDD instead of an SSD. The Ubuntu trend continued, and exposure to the command line that early taught me Bash Scripting, Python, Web Dev. and such. I started off creating hobby websites and apps for Android, most for my own fulfillment.</p><p>In fact, one of the earlier versions of this very domain used to be a website called "Guitar Rocks", a name I came up with during middle school but a website curated and implemented during high school. Mentioned in my undergraduate college applications, it became a cornerstone of my initial interest towards Computer Science, and merging my love for music + art with code (which has since evolved into perceiving code as a hobby). </p><p>While I worked on other interesting projects in high school (creating an alumni portal for my old school, or interning at Tata Consultancy Services), it was during university that I discovered my love for Systems and Compilers. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operating-systems-and-compilers">Operating Systems and Compilers<a href="#operating-systems-and-compilers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operating Systems and Compilers" title="Direct link to Operating Systems and Compilers">​</a></h3><p>Special shoutout to Tim Richards and Operating Systems (377), for getting me interested into this stuff. Long story short(ish), my love for CS began from tinkering with systems and computers. A lot of what I did over High School revolved around scripting, "reverse engineering", or building solutions that would solve a specific need of mine. </p><p>I fell in love with Operating Systems upon realizing that this was the biggest playground for tinkering with and understanding systems. CS 377 walked through each element of an Operating System, and I got familiar with the ideas of Scheduling, Context Switching, Multitasking, and so much more. Essentially, this course became the crux knowledge for my current Honors Thesis: Comparing and Contrasting Performance Differences Between RUST and C++ on x86 Platforms. </p><p>Things got even better when we were exposed to tinkering basically whatever in the Honors Colloquium of this class. We studied MIT PDOS xv6, an educational Operating System built for the RISC-V platform. Reading through the code, making changes to the Scheduling algorithms, and just trying to study the system was quite-possibly the biggest eye opener I have had in my Undergraduate Career, and was my cue to follow this domain to wherever it leads. </p><p>I love studying systems and tinkering with them. My goal, especially with Grad School, is to understand everything that there is about the intricate nature of computing, and to contribute something meaningful to the field. The idea of tinkeirng with systems, understanding their complexities, making it simple, and finding new breakthroughs excites me to no end. </p><p>I genuinely look forward to Grad School, crossing my fingers for that Early March Decisions. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="honors-thesis">Honors Thesis<a href="#honors-thesis" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Honors Thesis" title="Direct link to Honors Thesis">​</a></h2><p>Let us circle back for a quick moment. I mentioned about my Honors Thesis, here's what's happened and what I look forward to:</p><ul><li>I want to compare RUST and C++ as hey are two of the most popular low-level languages<ul><li>x86 Architecture as a baseline, Apple Silicon and ARM are still novel.</li><li>More theoritical in nature, nothing that can be solved by just "throwing more hardware towards the problem"<ul><li>Consistent findings ranging from RasPis, consumer laptops, to High Performance Computing</li></ul></li><li>LLVM base to maintain consistency</li></ul></li><li>How:<ul><li>Make the same exact programs in both languages</li><li>Trace the x86 Assembly output as it executes the program</li><li>Collect traces and analyze how many CPU resources used per language<ul><li>Take into account RUST's added security features and calculate performance overhead vs. developer peace</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>I am currently writing down findings. I very recently made the repository public for the Tracing tool, since that part has been done. I look forward to the completion of this project as well.</p><p>Tracer: <a href="https://github.com/cics-syslab/RUST-Tracing-Tool" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/cics-syslab/RUST-Tracing-Tool</a></p><p>More information on this soon.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="life">Life<a href="#life" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Life" title="Direct link to Life">​</a></h2><p>I think one of the big things that I have started to look forward is the trajectory of my own life, and how things pan out. The banner for this post was taken in Greenough Hall during a particularly-lonely evening, when I did not know how anything was panning out. After all, it was during Sophomore Year; I didn't even have any friends here given my Freshman year was all on Zoom due to the pandemic. </p><p>I think to finish this letter, I'd like to look back and pay some gratitude to the things that life has given me so far. I feel that I get caught up so much in trying to grasp where my future is leading me that I can forget how much has been achieved as well (I think we all do, to some extent).</p><p>I came in the U.S. having absolutely no clue as to how to navigate life, for the most part. Not just pertaining to my career, but really anything. Yes, I found my calling in Systems and I hope to hear back some good news in the upcoming weeks, but I also found a social circle that is equally into research and creating the world a better place. I found a partner who has been absolutely amazing and receptive of all my feelings and struggles. </p><p>I have found an amazing group of people to work with, ranging from students to professors. Personal projects such as MorbiOS and Saberstat are amazingly beautiful, and let me bring deranged ideas to life with other people. My career at Smith College has been the most amazing work experience, despite a tough job market. I extend my thanks to Prof. Ileana Streinu for the same.</p><p>Professor Scott Auerbach and the DOE TOP Challenge was one of the best projects I have undertaken, and ASSERT has been quite-possibly one of my first widespread in-use Open Source products. I also extend my thanks to him introducing the iCons program to me, quite possibly the biggest driver of my love for research and desire to continue in academia. Profs. Joe Chiu and Tim Richards have been amazing at fostering my love for systems and helping me conduct my Hons. Thesis.</p><p>Special mention to Prof. Parviz Kermani, for introducing Networking Architecture and exposing me to the Networking lab. WHilen it is just a course, I'd say it has been the most influential set of courses for me alongside 377 (OS) and 230 (Intro. to Systems).</p><p>I realize that my growth in the field has been a team effort including many people and events. University has been the biggest bloessing to my life: I went from knowing nothing (except having an interest in the field), to knowing exactly what I want to pursue.</p><p>I am grateful to all the people that have helped me foster my love for research and computation. This was not a vaccum, and I genuinely appreciate a lot of people (including all the people that I was not even able to mention, but helped me tremenduously).</p><p>I look forward to continuing my journey of understanding, implementing, and contributing to Systems Development. I am optimistic, albeit a little anxious. However, I am determined.</p><p>This newsletter has been fun to write. I'll close with a picture I took in Forza Horizon: a game that has been with me since Freshman Year of University.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Forza" src="/assets/images/FORZA-675efaffcc53341ea388c24d06ef92e8.png" width="3840" height="2160" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>PS: No blog next week, due to midterms.</p>]]></content>

I take a lot of pictures in my daily life, but most do not see the light of day, which is why I am going to attempt to merge my different art forms. The Photography page in the Finechive is still under construction, and hopefully it does not take long. </p><p>In today's newsletter we take a tour of Greentown Labs (well, at least what I am allowed to show on here), discuss the issues of Open Source Collaborators having to deal with arduos amounts of people who "feel they are entitled to a .exe", and I go over some of my own history of trying to maintain a platform such as this. Finishing off, we have some (read: one) cool thing I found on the Internet.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="greentown-labs">Greentown Labs<a href="#greentown-labs" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Greentown Labs" title="Direct link to Greentown Labs">​</a></h2><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Welcome to Greentown Labs Lobby" src="/assets/images/greentownLobby-51e83d2102b71437241aaa31ac515200.jpeg" width="2048" height="1536" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I had the opportunity to visit on a personalized tour of <a href="https://greentownlabs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Greentown Labs</a>: a Climatech Incubator providing resources to startups to achieve their maximum potential in developing cutting-edge solutions to combat Climate Change. They provide, essentially, lab space + funding + connections and networking to startups. They also provide legal advice to startups for licensing their IP to larger companies, and essentially do a lot of, for lack of a better term, insanely cool stuff. </p><p>I got an opportunity through <a href="https://icons.cns.umass.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UMass iCons</a> to visit the labs, and have a peek at all the amazing startups and the work being done there. From deicing airplane wings, to testing environmental structures in an indoor weather simulator; it is essentially an elevated makerspace. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Greentown Homepage" src="/assets/images/greentownHome-15271905f973441c122cf065e046d549.png" width="1534" height="722" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I got the furthermore opportunity to participate in their career fair, as well as talk to some people behind the scenes. <a href="https://greentownlabs.com/members/fleet-robotics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fleet Robotics</a> uses roomba-like robots to clean biofuling, <a href="https://greentownlabs.com/members/de-ice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">De-Ice</a> uses electric pulses over the body of an aircraft to de-ice the airplane, and <a href="https://greentownlabs.com/members/cyvl-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyvl.ai</a> uses Computer Vision to aid local governments in analyzing what road signs &amp; traffic equipment needs maintainance. </p><p>Huge shoutout to Marinna Teixeira '16 (<a href="https://instagram.com/marinnateix" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@marinnateix</a>) and Deanna Kenyon '19 (<a href="https://instagram.com/deerosekenyon" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@deerosekenyon</a>), at Greentown Labs in Somerville, MA for organizing this and graciously welcoming the 11th and 12th iCons cohorts to Greentown. </p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Greentown Labs Visit" src="/assets/images/greentownInsta-6c6ea85cb10d2ef89e5091f515e0ed7e.png" width="1311" height="639" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="vibin-out">Vibin' out<a href="#vibin-out" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Vibin' out" title="Direct link to Vibin' out">​</a></h2><p>These months currently feel like an Academic Limbo: a place where I am a bit uncertain as to how things may be headed. I am waiting on Grad Schools, finishing up on my Honors Thesis, and writing my drafts for <a href="https://honorspaths.honors.umass.edu/massurc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MassURC</a>, on top of already being committed to academic work. Personally, I have felt that while I do have a good framework of dealing with stress, I need to realize that I am not alone, and others are in this same journey as me. </p><p>I have been looking at ways to destress at times, and outside of my usual hobbies of Photography + Newslettring, I have found myself surfing the web to find hidden gems. One of them is a web-based game, <a href="https://slowroads.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">slowroads.io</a>. Put on some music, and drive on an endless road (in different times of day and weather conditions).</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Slowroads" src="/assets/images/slowroads-38af3d594c39ee9aa27bd9f6ad46695b.png" width="1535" height="861" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now, want some music to go along? <a href="https://poolsuite.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Poolsuite</a> has you covered with a website inspired by old MacOS and Windows, with 90s ads playing on loop and endless mixtapes on different radio channels. It is the perfect blend of neo-retroism.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Poolsuite" src="/assets/images/poolsuite-4eff5caa84dfada5e0bdda7ba720eaa6.png" width="1534" height="914" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Poolsuite and Slowroads are not my products, and belong to their respective owners. I just loved finding out about them.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="some-finechive-updates">Some Finechive Updates<a href="#some-finechive-updates" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Some Finechive Updates" title="Direct link to Some Finechive Updates">​</a></h2><p>Funnily enough, I have been writing blogs and online content in an on and off basis since 2017. The Finechive is also a place wherein I want to archive all my previous blogs and websites. It is a continual process, but look out at the <a href="/archive">archive</a> page for more info. A quick debrief:</p><ul><li>Minded Mindlessness was the last big blog effort I ran, from 2017-2019. </li><li>I had a high school blog before that</li><li>I used this domain between 2019-2020 for teaching music.</li><li>I now write this newsletter here :)</li></ul><p>Finding the bits of online content here and there has been a transformative experience for myself, to say the least. Minded Mindlessness was an effort with my then-partner, and reading that especially has instilled this deep sense of appreciation of how far we come in life. I was like 16 when i wrote those. While I have matured so much more than where I was at that time, so many of my traits and perspectives on life can be traced back to the moments when I last wrote that endeavour.</p><p>Similarly, my interests in my field can be seen today in my first blog as well, which was such a weird endeavour. I write about some politics, AI, Machine Learning, despite just having a very novel outlook towards such things. Yet, here I am specializing in the very thing, as well as working in low-level systems (stuff that makes everything else run, computationally speaking).</p><p>It's a bit beautiful, but I love looking back at life like this. Also, doesn't hurt you to reach out and say thanks to the people in your past, even after years of disconnect. Life's beautiful. </p><p>Outside of this, I think I will keep writing a mix of wacky internet stuff + personal stories and opinions on here. I'm still figuring this newsletter out, but I am excited about it's future. </p><p>It can become a bit tricky at times to know the direction of a specific creative endeavour. However, for the time being I am just uploading archives of these past experiences on this website. It is all completely done, except Minded Mindlessness. I will post an edit to this space once that is done as well.</p><hr>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Finechive 1 Banner" src="/assets/images/newsletter1-e52725bde479e07093a4e0e932532a29.png" width="590" height="593" class="img_ev3q"></p><blockquote><p>i wonder where i'll float next</p><p>-&gt; xkcd 1</p></blockquote><p>This has been the most scary step I have taken, even though I have maintained this blog for a long time. It feels so weirdly amazing to stick to a schedule, it feels beautiful and scary.</p><p>There have been quite a few times when I have talked about aesthetics, and I still believe that they are the best way to express myself. I have a <a href="/blog/liminal-spaces-art-of-appreciating">post here from last year diving into Liminal Spaces</a>, and to this day they capture the feeling of loneliness and eerieness perfectly. </p><p>A lot of the pictures I take pertain to outdoor Liminal Spaces. It is an interest that started during the Pandemic lockdowns, especially in a context where I was joining online Zoom meetings from the other corner of the globe. Going from interacting with over 15-20 people at a time on Discord to absolute silence at 4AM on the click of a button, I did not yet realize that I was living in a Liminal Space. </p><p>I go into great lengths to describe the journey into this rabbithole in that earlier post I have linked above, and would love for y'all to check out the same.</p><p>If we go back to the past post I just mentioned, I referred a <a href="https://youtu.be/olsXUqKTWgI?si=QI0p7Sx4qFIeTU9a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> by Cresendex on what defines a Liminal Space. To save some time, they define the three basic characterstics of Liminal Spaces:</p><ul><li>A transitory space</li><li>A sense of nostalgia</li><li>A dreamlike uncanniness </li></ul><p>While it is typically easy to take indoor hallway pictures (since they quite literally are Liminal Spaces), the feeling is even more difficult to capture outdoors, especially during broad daylight. However, years of capturing Liminal Spaces has made me pretty comfortable, with that too. </p><p>So far, I have achieved what was to be achieved in the first two. This post is about achieving the third.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="spaces-so-far">Spaces So Far<a href="#spaces-so-far" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Spaces So Far" title="Direct link to Spaces So Far">​</a></h2><p>The first steps I took in this journey were transitory spaces. They were the easiest to capture, I knew I had to take them on a road trip or similar. </p><p>A trick I did in the beginning of this journey was to create a more "dreamlike ethereal" feeling by heavily distorting the colors of the pictures. Nevertheless, I have had some absolutely gorgeous images, and here are some that I have taken over the years since I first started:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Empty Field" src="/assets/images/1-8093444fcd010d3c5b9ffe2ee2ffa697.png" width="960" height="960" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Distorted colors to achieve dreamlike feel, taken in 2020.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Gas Station" src="/assets/images/2-782520f24a7ca7187e34b446c8287d2d.png" width="811" height="767" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Gas Station in Hatfield, MA.

Very minor edits, this is an actual liminal space I experience. Taken in 2023.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Abandoned Lederle Physics Lab" src="/assets/images/4-a4756625b6e79c1b7a09644eb9ac5d6f.png" width="825" height="549" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A sunset through an abandoned lab at Lederle, minor edits. Taken in 2024.</p><p>I have more pictures I have taken in the other post, and also will be uploading them all (plus unpublished pictures) once the Photography page is up and running. But, we have nailed the first two aspects of a Liminal Space.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="sodata-bending">So...Data Bending?<a href="#sodata-bending" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So...Data Bending?" title="Direct link to So...Data Bending?">​</a></h2><p>Computers represent an astounding feat of engineering, functioning at their core by storing and manipulating data in the form of bits. The nature or structure of the data becomes inconsequential; in computer memory, all information is universally encoded as bits (you can verify this by opening any file in an editor, not just text files).</p><p>At its essence, we encounter the ubiquitous entity known as a file. A file is a digital container that encapsulates information, acting as a fundamental building block in the realm of computing. Whether it houses text, images, or complex algorithms, a file serves as the elemental unit through which computers organize, store, and retrieve data.</p><p>File formats, as we recognize them today, simply provide a standardized way to designate the type of a file, ensuring clarity and preventing user error. This facilitates seamless interaction with relevant software. However, it's vital to recognize that a file format is essentially a tag—a means for programmers to establish standardized characteristics. For instance, an MP3 file is tagged as a music file, with bits encoding sound wavelengths over time. This tag allows relevant software to recognize and process the file accordingly.</p><p>Nevertheless, beneath the surface, all files share a fundamental similarity, and are stored in the exactly same manner. The distinction lies in the representation of data within the container. This brings us to the intriguing concept of data bending.</p><p>Consider a picture, fundamentally a 2D array of pixel colors, where each point in the plane is assigned a specific color. This 2D array is processed by photo software to meet our requirements. Similarly, an audio file is also represented by a 2D array, and music-making software anticipates this format. By altering the file format of a picture, it is possible to deceive the music software into interpreting it as audio—effectively <em>bending</em> the data and producing captivating glitch effects.</p><p>Let's dive into this a bit more:</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="glitching-lederle">Glitching Lederle<a href="#glitching-lederle" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Glitching Lederle" title="Direct link to Glitching Lederle">​</a></h2><p>We are going to use this image as our testbench.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Lederle on a Cloudy Morning" src="/assets/images/5-78572d884e2362854ce287265ba9c5bc.png" width="1536" height="2048" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>(Have we identified my favourite building on the UMass Amherst Campus??)</p><p>I altered the file format to MP3 without making any adjustments to the image itself. As expected, given that a file serves as a mere container, Audacity—a digital audio workstation, or music editing software—accepts it without issue, presuming it to be an audio file. Although no audible sound is produced, no error is triggered either.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Audacity taking in my &amp;quot;MP3&amp;quot;" src="/assets/images/6-db6cdd51a40aabcc12ed5d087e960e73.png" width="1120" height="724" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now, let's explore and experiment a bit! 😄</p><p>I modified the pitch of the final third of the image and introduced an echo effect to the middle third. Here's a visual representation of the alterations in Audacity:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Audacity showing my image and edits" src="/assets/images/7-d4e5b81047c70c073511c528650b21f8.png" width="945" height="369" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Now, time to export this as a RAW file, and change the format back to .bmp (uncompressed image) so that we can open it in an image viewer:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Audacity Edited" src="/assets/images/8-6fd068467eefdb8f141e0e2545490d97.jpeg" width="1536" height="2048" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Woozy, right??</p><p>Since a file is just a container, if the data representation is close enough in the two files: we can pretty much manipulate a file format meant for one type of file in a software that was meant to edit something completely different. That, to me, is insanely cool. </p><p>It's the kind of stuff that makes my career interesting to me!! :D</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="some-more-edits">Some more edits<a href="#some-more-edits" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Some more edits" title="Direct link to Some more edits">​</a></h2><p>The following are me just selecting most of the whole image (Ctrl + A messes header files and corrupts the whole thing, I am still getting the hang of it), and applying one effect to it.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Newsletter Banner]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><img loading="lazy" alt="Newsletter Banner" src="/assets/images/finechive-newsletter-481b8251606e11b044d86a4b0e484101.png" width="2000" height="600" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>This is more so a way to streamline my own thoughts and creative ideas, but I have decided to convert this blog space into somewhat of a newsletter. Here's why I say "sort of":</p><ul><li>For starters, I am not going to have an email functionality here. This is going to solely be a space for me to write down thoughts and convey them.</li><li>We are not trying to build an audience, just yet. We are trying to just create something special.</li><li>Threading (Tweeting on Threads) is not cutting it for me. That's too constraining. </li><li>Each page of the Finechive relates to a big (non-career related) project. However, ideas come and go. This is the point I want to hold on to, for a bit.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-approach-and-how-it-is-changing">the approach, and how it is changing.<a href="#the-approach-and-how-it-is-changing" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to the approach, and how it is changing." title="Direct link to the approach, and how it is changing.">​</a></h2><p>The biggest problem in my approach has been the reluctance to treat this blog as a main project. So far, this has pretty much been a dump of my ideas that come and go. I have written about these ideas in great depth, but as a result I only post here very rarely. </p><p>Every other page in the Finechive is a project that has been going on, independent of my career (yes, even the code ones). However, that means that by nature of the projects, those pages get updated quite rarely. Granted, updates are good, but it is more of a directory of what I am doing currently (more so, what I am doing not directly in my career as such).</p><p>Ideas, on the other hand, come and go. Ideas cannot stick to a "Project" page, they need a medium of communication. I have tried blogging before, albeit have never been able to reach the heights of my high-school blog (which remains archived for the time being). </p><p>Pivoting to a separate problem, another issue I am having is managing my creative projects. I recently got into Digital Art, Djing, and Photography (as mentioned in <a href="https://skushagra.com/blog/dreaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a previous Blog post</a>). While each of these are going to get their own pages in the Finechive, a newsletter also helps me keep myself in check, and convey the daily progress on these avenues without having to wait for sweeping changes to be made in this space.</p><p>Most importantly, it helps me have a big picture of where each of these new creative endeavours are headed to, so that the more sweeping changes on my actual archive make sense. The creative endeavours are basically classified as Sound, Indoor Creativity, and Outdoor Creativity, They will have their own pages, but also I will put stuff here.</p><p>The way I see it unfolding is that Photography &amp; Art will have merged in their own little proper finechive page (the current <a href="https://skushagra.com/docs/finechive/photography" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Photography</a> page), and I will have also started publishing my Music Lirary in yet another Finechive page. This is not set in stone, and will most definitely change as we keep going further into this rabbithole. For now, I am elated to have these means of creative expressions.</p><p>Every Tuesday at 4PM EST, I will have a new post here. Something interesting, opinionated, really anything. But I need to get a medium for a creative flow of ideas, and not just updates on the more major projects I am doing. Think of this as a "budget version" of the <a href="https://tomscott.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tom Scott Newsletter</a>, which is free to begin with and has so clearly not been the motivation behind this idea.</p><p>Once I have consistently posted a newsletter for 8 Mondays, the newsletter will officially have a link on my homepage.</p><hr>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Even though I am not exactly there yet, I often like to classify myself as a Libre Source Developer. Let's get into this terminology first.</p><p>Libre Source, for the most part, is very much in parallels with Open Source Development: i.e., people can see the source of your code, fork it, compile it, and distribute it. There exist different licenses that lay down the permissions for what most users can do with it. The most popular, in the Open Source world, is the <a href="https://opensource.org/license/mit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MIT License</a></p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="MIT License" src="/assets/images/mit-9ecd09e6779d484bedbaef10a12b0cf3.jpeg" width="5088" height="3690" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Essentially, this is a "do whatever you want- including making this closed source- as long as you retain that copyright notice" license.</p><p>Which brings to the crucial difference between Open vs. Libre: the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GPL License</a> (along with the many others, like the MPL or Apache 2.0)</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="GPL License" src="/assets/images/gpl-7091f3f357ad6af4c2fe8df89ee8e3c5.jpeg" width="5088" height="3690" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Without diving too much into the text, it essentially says that any derivative works have to remain open source &amp; accessible to all. Now, the GPL itself is sometimes criticized for being too restrictive, but the overarching theme is that any derivative work remain free (as in freedom, not in free beer), and the 4 essential freedoms are maintained here.</p><p>I go a little bit deeper into my appreciation for the GPL in the README for <a href="https://github.com/suobset/assert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ASSERT</a>.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="ASSERT Readme" src="/assets/images/assert-7ba7fda98eb8975d3940d3832b6c75a0.jpeg" width="5088" height="3690" class="img_ev3q"></p><hr><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="so-what-is-the-deal-with-the-macintosh">So, what is the deal with the Macintosh?<a href="#so-what-is-the-deal-with-the-macintosh" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to So, what is the deal with the Macintosh?" title="Direct link to So, what is the deal with the Macintosh?">​</a></h2><p>Controversial-ish opinion (coming from a Linux user): The Mac is one of the best UNIX environments today that facilitates this development. Which is weird, because the people behind the GPL (The Free Software Foundation), really do not receive it well at times given how closed the system is.</p><p>The Mac technically does not comply with GPL requirements, yet most of FOSS development takes place on that platform (including many new and shiny devtools). It uses quite a lot of OSS components under the hood, and comes with exceptional support, making it the default developer choice for a UNIX-based platform.</p><p>This means that for any developer, Macs become the default choice. And for any new developer tool, Macs become the first target platform.</p><p>Case study: I have been wanting to try 2 different code editors (both Open Sourced), which are Mac only:</p><p>The first is CodeEdit, a native macOS editor which is licensed under MIT. Completely letting this slide off, the project is a native macOS one, that does not need to cater to other platforms. The focus is right there, and it is solving the issue at hand:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="CodeEdit" src="/assets/images/CodeEdit-cf8476e3c7d0d96c7b614838eb9b4657.jpeg" width="5088" height="3690" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>However, this rabbit hole of "finding a new editor" led me to Zed Editor, which currently got entirely Open Sourced under the GPL License, yet does not run on any Linux computer as of writing this post:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Zed" src="/assets/images/zed-6565a63c18dc8d252d0609b0c57909ed.jpeg" width="5088" height="3690" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>And let's not forget the browser that I am screenshotting this on (even though it is not Open Sourced, yet:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Arc" src="/assets/images/arc-53c1e3808c39a0ed7e1e0abc91bc85ee.jpeg" width="5088" height="3690" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I do not daily this Mac. This is my old computer, which has been retired and sits as a YouTube machine.</p><p>Yet, by virtue of the Mac providing a UNIX-like experience outside the box, it has quite become the default developer platform. Even if you're not a Systems person like me, having a Mac gives you the freedom to make apps for any platform &amp; an unparalleled Web-dev experience (the Mac restriction foor iOS development is purely Apple-imposed, but makes sense).</p><p>To me, it is fascinating to see the number of Free-as-in-Freedom software having only macOS as their targets (or Windows for some, like Notepad++).</p><p>It makes me keep coming back to my butterfly-keyboard thermal-throttling underpowered 2016 MacBook to experience these new developments, until they make my way to my actual daily computer :')</p><p>Some things here may be misunderstood so let me clear some points</p><ul><li>Every project has its purpose, and needs a focus. I am not attacking any developers in this post; I am genuinely so happy to see so many new projects in the FOSS world. Zed, CodeEdit, and Arc are amazing projects and deserve all the love (&amp; contributions)</li><li>I am using these examples as a "case study".

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I often like to mention how my career today started off as a childhood dream. While this is not false, coming here meant giving up on a different dream. </p><p>I had always been passionate about music &amp; art, and specifically creating it. However, I was never able to afford the equipment required to pursue this passion. As a result, my primary form of expressing artistic creativity went towards Code.</p><p>I still think of programming as a form of art, for all intents and purposes. You are given a blank canvas, in the form of whatever device the user has...and you can design experiences of any kinds and forms. Ranging from Video Games to Websites to apps that help in the everyday, coding is a form of art, and one of the few that enables the consumer to interact with it as well, instead of just looking at it.</p><p>However, I am at a point where I want to rekindle the actual artistic side of things. This includes some software for DJing, for digital art, and for photography (sound, indoor creativity, outdoor creativity). I will try to dabble into this realm and post more updates.</p><p>Until next time :)</p>]]></content>

This blog is part of my "digital garden": a virtual space to collect raw thoughts as is. This is not a reflection of UMass Amherst, iCons, U.S. Census Dept, The Opportunity Project, and any/every organization mentioned. <strong>This space only exists to collect personal thoughts, and is very informal, and not representative of any ideas, thoughts, or emotions behind anything</strong>. </p><p>Visit the <a href="/docs/category/undergraduate">Research</a> Page to learn more on the academic end of this project. That is where I document the crucial, tangible, proper outcomes of this project. </p><p>Think of this blog as a personal virtual journal :)</p><p><a href="https://opportunity.census.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Opportunity Project</a> is a Project of the <a href="https://census.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">U.S. Census Department</a>, which I have had the honor and privilege of participating in through the <a href="https://icons.cns.umass.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Integrated Concentration in STEM at UMass Amherst</a>.

Lemonade time!!</p><p>I have been personally working with a team of 6 on <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Opportunity Project</a>: a semester-long sprint to conduct data analysis and create a digital tool that helps address a social issue: electricity outage burden in certain communities, in the case of iCons. The project includes STEM majors from iCons, along with Dr. Scott Auerbach of iCons, and tremendous help from The Department of Energy. </p><p>As part of the sprint, one of us were initially invited to speak about it at Justice Week 2023: a week-long event to showcase efforts and successes towards Energy Equity. In true iCons fashion, however, we fought for everyone to be present, since everyone in their domain contributed whatever they could. </p><p>However, long story short: I could not get in, mainly due to me being an International Student trying to access a Federal Building. Since the tickets and my hotel room were already booked, I am still coming along. </p><p>The following will be notes from my first-ever solo trip, unplanned at that. This document will keep updating until Thursday, November 2, at 12:00PM EST.

Apparrently, I have a tendency to make things more complicated. Nevertheless, this gave me about an hour of sleep, and I packed my stuff at 6AM and left for the shuttle. Somehow I had insanely bad sore throat in the morning, which may have resulted due to some allergies.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Van pic time" src="/assets/images/vanpic-b5bed4f810573030821afe6a0467a17e.jpg" width="4032" height="3024" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li>Reached airport and stuff.

        <updated>2023-10-10T00:00:00.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Welcome]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="welcome"><img loading="lazy" alt="Welcome" src="/assets/images/finechive-banner-ea61b1b48e498411017d001a6677ac77.png" width="2000" height="600" class="img_ev3q"><a href="#welcome" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to welcome" title="Direct link to welcome">​</a></h2><p>I think I have always had an identity crisis when it comes to the concept of blogging. On one hand, I find it to be one of the most approachable mediums on the Internet, far more accessible than making videos or fancy schmancy websites. On the other hand, how do you get consistency when it comes to writing down your thoughts?</p><p>See, the main issue when it coes to writing down "blog content" is that I am not a writer, nor do I have enough time to actually sit down and think of new ideas. Writing things down occurs to me sporadically: sometimes there exist things that move me to such an extent that I am compelled to write down about them. It is a fine method of doing this, especially since I am not doing this professionally, but it leaves a lot of consistency to be desired and ideas to be explored. </p><p>Over the years, the concept of writing down things on the Internet has not been the same for me. Under the <a href="/blog/archive">Archive</a> page of this URL, you'll notice my previous attempts at this medium in 2017, along with another following in 2019 (which was not under this URL). It started off as a place for me to vent, and quickly moved into a text-based form of vlogging (or rather, we came back full circle on methods-of-describing-your-life). Quite honestly, I do not think that both of these intents are something that I'd be comfortable sharing at this point, or matters that anyone will want to read about.</p><p>I want my blog as an area to communicate on ideas, as opposed to daily occurrings. However, I also do not want to trap myself into only communicating about a specific subject matter. I want this space to flourish as a means for me to be able to communicate whatever it is that inspires me at a certain given moment, while also giving me enough creative freedom to write down abut daily occurrences shoulod something inspiring happen. Essentially, I need an archive. </p><p>It was about 2 days ago when upon researching into this concept, I came across the idea of a "Digital Garden". While the concept itself was born in the 90s, digital gardens have superseded the concept of "Personal Websites" into spaces that give one the flexibility to put down their thoughts on, and nurture over time. Just like the concept of a real garden, with enough time and nurturing (in the form of putting down thoughts and ideas), you can create your own digital garden as a manifestation of your ideas. The whole thing has a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a> as well :)</p><p>Thus, I am in the process of converting this space into a Digital Garden, as opposed to a blog. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-story-behind-finechive">The story behind Finechive<a href="#the-story-behind-finechive" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The story behind Finechive" title="Direct link to The story behind Finechive">​</a></h2><p>As a name, finechive = fine + archive, i.e. an archive of all the fine things in life. In practicality, the Finechive was a project that I wanted to start about a month ago: an archive of all digital media that I found valuable enough to preserve. There were just 2 issues with that concept:</p><ol><li>Copyright laws would prevent me from hosting any forms of media.</li><li><a href="https://archive.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Internet Archive</a> already does an excellent job of maintaining an archive, and I'd actually encourage you to check them out and donate if possible. </li></ol><p>Thus, the entire project has been revamped into creating a so-called "archive of my mind". I will try toput down many of my thoughts and outlooks into here, without trying to worry too much about consistency. That being said, the current iteration of finechive has some issues that I would like to resolve.</p><ul><li>No information is stored into your brain as is; rather, all information is linked to one another in some way or the other. I would love to try and create a graph that can showcase all the ideas and thoughts I have written down here, and what/how they're linked to each other.</li><li>The blog format can hinder hierarchy and organization. This is something that I'd try to fix. </li></ul><p>However, I see these issues as mainly optional. For now, I will just keep on writing here as usual, and soon see if there is any organization that is needed to be done (or if the blog format is working out well). I will attempt to write here twice every week, also attaching pictures taken by me throughout the week.</p><p>Until next time.</p>]]></content>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Originally published by me on Medium]]></summary>
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Originally published by me on <a href="https://medium.com/@skushagra/liminal-spaces-the-art-of-being-in-and-appreciating-the-in-between-4f020bb92103" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a></p><hr><p>This is an attempt at documenting what has been long gone by, and yet seems coming right across the horizon. This is a story of a particular phase of my own life, how it has been influenced by my past, and how it delves into one of my favorite aesthetics of all time.</p><p>This will also be an attempt to capture my version of that aesthetic.</p><hr><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chapter 1" src="/assets/images/1-02fd2743609c00220054792d84374a5d.webp" width="720" height="406" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The beginning of what would culminate into a series of developing multiple aspects into what my life would really turn out to be started right around the corner of me transitioning from my High School phase to my University phase; at a time when every single person on the planet was transitioning away from life as they had known into one that was being navigated in the midst of a global pandemic.</p><p>See, change is difficult for people to grasp. While an inevitable construct, the human mind still opposes change as it then has to deal with us fighting for our survival needs, and trying to make the best of whatever situation it is that is presented to us. For me, this was a period of change in three major ways: transitioning from school to university (essentially leaving life as I had known it for over 12 years), transitioning towards navigating a world with a surreal level of precaution, and transitioning to a new country altogether to study further.</p><p>I come from a background wherein everything that I have experienced in life has been ephemeral, especially since my family worked a profession which required us getting transferred to multiple places. Hence, while transitioning in itself has not been too difficult for me: the uncertainty of the time, coupled with me having to do this on my own for once, proved me wrong for once.</p><p>In between me having to embark on this journey, and staying inside due to the pandemic: I started to introspect more into my own thoughts. I had been busy with life until now: but this was the first time I slowed down, and I looked at places, people, and the surroundings that I had not really thought much about before.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chapter 2" src="/assets/images/2-9fff286701785ece2ae23227601b16be.webp" width="1640" height="924" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>I started creating. I had never created before, even though I always knew I wanted to create. I had programmed stuff before, and I had played the guitar before. But to do something which is your own creation, from the beginning to the end? I was too scared of it. In fact, part of me is still scared of it to a great extent. It is the reason why I am so hesitant to write up anything on the platform you are reading this on.</p><p>Nevertheless, I persisted. It started with me realizing my lifelong hobby for the first time in its entirety: I started coding and creating mobile apps which would handhold one learning music; I created multiple aspects of the remote-learning management system for my school; I created a NFC based app to exchange contact details; I started creating. I created new music; I created wonky sounds; I co-created a podcast which never got traction; I created workflows that would break my soul as I realized how much more difficult creating anything could be.</p><p>I created anything and everything: crouched up in my room, hunched over my laptop for as long as 18–20 hours a day; that did not matter as I was creating for the very joy of just creating.</p><p>I started enjoying my time, living in this weird zone of the in-between. There were no pure proper lockdown measures where I was living yet, but a lot of people were still acknowledging the pandemic, and public places were almost entirely devoid of any human presence. Ranging from my balcony, to roaming around in my old high school devoid of any one, I enjoyed my presence in these spaces where I felt like I did not technically belong.</p><p>I was stuck in multiple transitionary phases of my own life: trying to find my own identity, anxious about my own future, and the future of the world. However, there was a weird feeling of solace when I found myself roaming around the hallways of my old school at 8PM, or a supermarket devoid of 98% of the people, or just looking at the highway from my balcony with zero cars at a time which would be considered rush hour.</p><p>Human-built places outside of ones that have any personal meaning (such as your home) are built with an immense level of utilitarian mindset and purpose. Think about it: a school hallway gets its life from the people that surround it during the day. It is the period of time when even you exist in it. To see it in the night-time, devoid of any people and any life, filled with an endless repetition of lockers, classroms, and furniture: what set of events happened that led one person to even be here? And why was this terrifying, yet comforting in a way?</p><p>And then it hit me. I enjoyed existing in a space which was only transitionary in nature: one that is never paid close attention to, or given the amount of respect it deserves. I paid attention to what went un-noticed by everyone else, and at unconventional times, became completely frozen and devoid of life.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chapter 3" src="/assets/images/3-fa21a864e5135e6e530ad2ece4bade6a.webp" width="1097" height="1091" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>September 2020: I started university as an international student halfway across the world. To manage the time difference, I set my clock to the local time of my university, and then decided to never look outside the window.</p><p>This approach, coupled with the already frozen-nature of the pandemic (still at an all-time high) resulted in me solely existing in the in-between. I would be up throughout the night, and sleep during the day.</p><p>This would mean no outside world contact, very limited contact with my family that’d be sleeping while I was awake (and vice versa), and existing in a state of pure loneliness except for when I was on a Zoom call. One moment you’re on this call enjoying a 3 hour game night with friends, the next moment said call has ended and now you’re all alone, in utter silence, transitioning to your next call of the night.</p><p>It was during this time that I started experimenting with documenting the feeling that I’d get whenever I was existing in these transitional spaces: ranging from empty school hallway, to hotel rooms that I had to stay in during pandemic-related travelling, to even the feeling of dread when I was done with a phone call and had no one to speak to.</p><p>It was during this time, that YouTube recommended me to this particular video, which did a great job of conveying what I was trying to capture far better than anything I had done myself (courtesy of YouTuber <a href="https://youtu.be/KJfew0PXSAk?si=U-KR6g7Pb_ujYWpY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MiacDaled</a>):</p><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KJfew0PXSAk?si=M6kc7U88Hoqf0ZCE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share"></iframe><p>I was unknowingly appreciating <a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Liminal_Space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Liminal Spaces</a>: an aesthetic that portrays empty spaces which are given meaning only through the existence of people in it. While in technical terms the word “liminal” refers to a transition, thus making “liminal spaces” places that help you transition from one point to another, it is a bit more than that.</p><p>Liminal Spaces have this tendency to evoke emotions of nostalgia, yet reside in the uncanny valley for almost everyone, regardless of your specific background. They feel familiar, yet are distorted just enough for one to not feel entirely at home.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Weinstein" src="/assets/images/4-d8d36a476f1229eb69cf1ddfefdedded.webp" width="720" height="540" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>By being stripped of its essential context, for example, the auditorium above may evoke a sense of unease. You have never been here before, yet you have memories of being in an auditorium like the one above. You know the feeling of those spring-seats, the texture of the carpet, and the feedback noise of the microphone. You expect to see people, and hear them chattering. Yet, here you’re presented the same space, at a state that you are not expected to have visited it. The question is not why is no one here, the question is why are you here?</p><p>The more you roam in this space, stripped of its context, the more you are paying attention to details that went un-noticed at first. You are forced to take in details of the seats, the carpets, the ceiling beams…you cannot focus on anyone, since there is not anyone there. Your fear does not stem from anticipating the presence of anyone else, it stems from anticipating why are you existing in this space.</p><p>Yet, despite the uneasiness, they evoke a sense of familiarity and belonging. There are aspects of this room that all of us have experienced: physical and emotional. Distortions, no-context anxiety, yet familiarity of such spaces evoke emotions of nostalgic dread that a lot of us have simply not felt: only because you are forced to really take-into what you had taken for-granted.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chapter 4" src="/assets/images/5-d69747e6e12174b0687d03c02d687de0.webp" width="1640" height="924" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>There is a reason why this term was coined in 2020: the world was in itself a Liminal Space at the time of the pandemic. It was noticed in a way it was never supposed to be noticed, with lockdown mandates essentially forcing everyone to exist in the transitionary state, waiting for anything to happen. Public spaces that had been given purpose were meaningless, and the deathday looming coupled with the period of not having any medical cures or vaccines led to everyone existing in an emotional liminal space of their own.</p><p>As an aesthetic, Liminal Spaces are heavy into using imagery from the 2000s and 1990s, trying to reach out to a time that has long gone by, created by people before us who had experiences that we will never be able to experience ourselves. Yet, in these unreachable experiences, are interlaced our own that we are very familiar with, yet choose to never introspect upon.</p><p>In this <a href="https://youtu.be/olsXUqKTWgI?si=EIaPEywX853EmMYF" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, YouTuber Cresendex does a deep analysis of the entire aesthetic, and why it speaks to them. They point out three major aspects of what makes a Liminal Space evoke undiscovered emotions: a transitory nature, a sense of nostalgia, and a dream-like uncanniness. There had not been a time before this pandemic, to experience these three aspects interwoven into daily-lives in a way that was almost forced down upon one, as opposed to them actively seeking out these experiences.</p><p>To really try and give a sense of what I am trying to convey, here is my all-time favourite Liminal Space rendition:</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Reddit" src="/assets/images/6-207a4be740a38737cf42998febbf035d.webp" width="640" height="305" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Image Credits: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiminalSpace/comments/oncbrk/petrol_station_after_a_good_downpour/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;utm_content=3&amp;utm_term=22" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">u/Moistwee on</a> <a href="https://reddit.com/r/LiminalSpaces" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">r/LiminalSpaces</a></p><p>I have memories of coming back from long road trips when I was a child, half-sleepy and tired from the long car ride. I remember stargazing, resting my head on the vibrating window of the car, being slightly hungry and uneasy, up well past my bedtime in the middle of nowhere. A gas station stop, with its smells and subpar food felt almost heavenly after being trapped in a car for 6 hours or such. Trying to look at the time on my digital watch with the help of the passing streetlights, looking at other vehicles momentarily as they pass us…I have recollections of entire memories about this image which is not even taken by me.</p><p>I would highly recommend Cresendex’s video above, which dives into more forms of Liminal Spaces which I have not covered here, yet resonate to.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Chapter 5" src="/assets/images/7-5a32bb0454240198fe16ffade13dedcc.webp" width="720" height="471" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the context of my own life, liminal spaces have become one of these cherished treasures that I keep going out of my way to experience over and over again. It has become my own medium of exploring my feelings and emotions, and has made me appreciate the powerful nature of being alone.</p><p>We have a tendency to get caught up with so many things that happen around us, that even classes and retreats that force us to be alone and meditate are not truly alone in nature. They serve a purpose, and still have people around them.</p><p>To truly grasp the value of nothingness is the catalyst to realize the value of yourself. Liminal Spaces are beautiful because they have a purpose, but only during a specific time and context. Outside of them, they have nothing: no activity, no value, and no purpose. We attribute these places to our own nostalgia, since we have all been to places as such, but to see them out of context can lead us to a journey that maybe helps us find our own self worth.</p><p>Let us appreciate the value of spaces which are given value because of us, and take a moment to introspect these spaces, and by extension introspect our own selves.</p><p>Lastly, I would suggest everyone to play 2:22AM, to experience what I have been trying to say. I promise, you will not regret it. It is not horror. Thank Cresendex for the recommendation.</p><p>Until next time.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="End" src="/assets/images/8-ac543b4ac6926c5392c4f8b983c484e5.jpg" width="1080" height="1080" class="img_ev3q"></p><hr><p>All pictures have been taken by me, except where mentioned. I still capture the Liminal Spaces I exist in, along with other things and aesthetics as well.

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The most difficult part of starting a new journey is taking that first step.</p><hr><p>There is an endless amount of fear and joy inside me as I embark on this new journey. For months on end, I have been wanting to streamline my artistic journey, and it finally seems like things are coming together.</p><p><img loading="lazy" alt="Cover Art for the Blog | Clicked by Kush Srivastava on Flickr" src="/assets/images/welcome-1-dd19cebc443664f60b2be343513c403b.webp" width="720" height="540" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>It all started with a love to create; create anything, anywhere, anyhow that I want it to be. I started off with a Guitar in middle school, and the love to create has taken me ever since towards getting classically trained, getting into computer science, and more lately: getting into photography, and into blogging (wherein I use the latter two in a combined fashion).</p><p>I cannot wait to tap into my creative ideas as we move forward together. As of now, this space here is going to act as my not-so-personal journal: a space where I just speak about my experiences, ideas, opinions, and everything plus more.</p><p>Moreover, as a very personal touch, every picture on this blog will be clicked by me (yes, I’ll be clicking a meaningful picture almost everyday for this project).</p><p>A lot of inspiration for this space came from my past experiences in blogging, Casey Neistat, bitbird, and just a sheer desire to create something meaningful everyday. I hope you enjoy your stay here, and I cannot thank you enough if you’re reading this.</p><p>Love ❤</p>]]></content>
