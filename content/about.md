I'm **Kushagra Srivastava**, a CS Masters student at Northeastern University specializing in operating systems and compilers. I build systems-level software and care deeply about how computers actually work.

[Prefer my Resume?](/resume)

## What I Work On

My focus is low-level systems programming—the kind of work where you're thinking about memory layouts, build systems, and why something takes 40 minutes to compile when it should take 9.

**Current interests:** Operating systems, compiler development, molecular dynamics simulation, LLMs as an accessibility tool, and making software that respects both the machine and the person using it.

## Current Projects

**[STORMM](https://psivant.com/)** — Molecular dynamics simulation software at Psivant Therapeutics.

**[tra86](https://tra86.skushagra.com/)** — An x86 assembly stack tracer I built for my honors thesis at UMass Amherst. The thesis compared Rust and C++ performance at the assembly level using modified GDB tracing.

**[SelfSelect / Automator](https://github.com/suobset/automator)** — An LLM-powered automation platform. The Android version uses Gemini to translate natural language commands into YAML scripts executed via Accessibility Services. I'm now building a desktop version using MCP servers with support for Hindi language input.

**[RavynOS / Swift on FreeBSD](https://ravynos.com/)** — Contributing to the effort of bringing Swift 6 to FreeBSD as part of the RavynOS project, working toward a macOS-compatible open source operating system.

**SaberStat** — An Apple Watch app for lightsaber dueling that uses IMU sensors for hit detection. Still refining the signal processing for acceleration magnitude and peak finding.

## Background

I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University, focusing on operating systems and compilers.

Before this, I worked at Psivant Therapeutics as a Systems/Software Developer on STORMM, a molecular dynamics framework. That role taught me a lot about large-scale scientific software and high performance computation.

I studied Computer Science at UMass Amherst (BS, Honors), where my thesis compared Rust and C++ performance at the assembly level. My first Linux experience was Ubuntu on an Intel Atom netbook in 7th grade—I wrote code on underpowered hardware because that's what I had. That's probably why I care so much about efficient software now.

## Interests

**Retro computing** — PowerBook G3, Acer eeePC, Macintosh System 9, SUN Solaris, and anything that makes you appreciate how far we've come (or haven't). I own actual hardware!!

**Right-to-repair** — I believe strongly that you should be able to fix what you own.

**Lightsaber battles** — Seriously enough to build an Apple Watch app for it.

I think programming is an art form. I prefer well-crafted, platform-native software over cross-platform compromises. I'll take a thoughtfully designed tool over a feature-bloated one every time.
