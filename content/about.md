I'm **Kushagra Srivastava**, a CS Masters student at Northeastern University specializing in operating systems and compilers. I build systems-level software and care deeply about how computers actually work.

## What I Work On

My focus is low-level systems programming—the kind of work where you're thinking about memory layouts, build systems, and why something takes 40 minutes to compile when it should take 9.

**Current interests:** Operating systems, compiler development, molecular dynamics simulation, LLMs as an accessibility tool, and making software that respects both the machine and the person using it.

## Current Projects

## Background

I'm currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University, focusing on operating systems and compilers.

Before this, I worked at Psivant Therapeutics as a Systems/Software Developer on STORMM, a molecular dynamics framework. That role taught me a lot about large-scale scientific software and high performance computation.

I studied Computer Science at UMass Amherst (BS, Honors), where my thesis compared Rust and C++ performance at the assembly level. My first Linux experience was Ubuntu on an Intel Atom netbook in 7th grade—I wrote code on underpowered hardware because that's what I had. That's probably why I care so much about efficient software now.

## Interests

**Retro computing** — PowerBook G3, Acer eeePC, Macintosh System 9, SUN Solaris, and anything that makes you appreciate how far we've come (or haven't). I own actual hardware!!

**Right-to-repair** — I believe strongly that you should be able to fix what you own.

**Lightsaber battles** — Seriously enough to build an Apple Watch app for it.

I think programming is an art form. I prefer well-crafted, platform-native software over cross-platform compromises. I'll take a thoughtfully designed tool over a feature-bloated one every time.

This site runs on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) with a custom theme I built—amber terminal aesthetics meets classic Mac typography. No JavaScript frameworks were harmed in the making of this blog.
