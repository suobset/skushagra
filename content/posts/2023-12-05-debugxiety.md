```(noun) /dɪˌbʌɡzaɪ.əti/```

Definition: The apprehensive and uneasy feeling experienced by a programmer when faced with the prospect of executing or testing code, particularly after investing a significant amount of time in its creation, due to the anticipation of potential errors, bugs, or the need for extensive debugging.

Example: Sarah hesitated to run the program she had been tirelessly working on for days, overcome by a wave of debugxiety as she feared encountering unforeseen issues that might demand prolonged debugging sessions.

Etymology: Blend of "debugging" and "anxiety."
