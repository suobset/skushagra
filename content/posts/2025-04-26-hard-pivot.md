I am revamping the website under this domain for the fourth time in its lifespan since 2017. The website naturally goes over an update every 3-ish years, but I have my reasons to pivot it solely to a blog, and not necessarily into a portfolio + blog as it was before.

Posts before this specific posts have been ported from the previous instance, but run the risk of having broken links and outdated info. They should be taken for what they are: archives. Moving forward, the focus of this blog is going to be more on my career, and hobbies (programming, photography, music, art). There's a specific reason for this:

- Instagram: Covers my personal life
- LinkedIn: Portfolio
- GitHub: Code
- ORCiD: Publications
- Previous iteration of this website: Portfolio + Personal life + Code + Publications + Blog

While the website was my go-to place to put any updates first, it neglected the other platforms I was on (and/or it created redundancy). Moreover, my connections (professional and personal) were not necessarily going to check my website for any such updates. Most drastically, it meant that the Blog was relegated as a sub-page of the main website: when that was the only non-redundant thing it had going for itself. The main landing page was my portfolio: which is also easily viewable if you go to my LinkedIn.

I want to give writing things on my hobbies and career a proper try. Which means, I have to put the blog- the non-redundant thing- front and center of this domain. Hence, here I am today with a new blog and a new name: Forged Assembly (get it? i write a lot of assembly). This blog is devoid of anything which can easily be found on my LinkedIn and Instagram.

The other big aspect I wanted to highlight in this new venture were my Photography skills. I always used my own photos as Blog thumbnails on my old website, and I continue to do so here. In my older website, the photos were hidden one layer under the blog, when you clicked on an article (so 2 layers from the main homepage, with no way of seeing them in a gallery format). The new layout makes sure the photos are front and center, with cover photo(s) of the month on the landing page.

As the cover photos change (I might do it multiple times a month, but at least once every month), I will use the old one as a cover for a new blog entry to retain them in a gallery view.

Thank you for being here. I look forward to publishing this blog.
