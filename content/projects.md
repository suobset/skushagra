I do a lot of projects, which can range a lot between what they achieve and the context they were created in. Most of my projects were created in UMass Amherst during my undergrad, but I also have created many personal projects. These projects range from Systems Developer tools for my specialization/research, to fun web apps and mobile apps that either solve a very specific need I had, or ones that I just wanted to do. The following is a non-exhaustive list of things I have worked on.

## Ongoing Projects

**[Blot](https://blot.skushagra.com/)** — An x86 assembly stack tracer I built for my honors thesis at UMass Amherst. The thesis compared Rust and C++ performance at the assembly level using modified GDB tracing.

**[SelfSelect / Automator](https://github.com/suobset/automator)** — An LLM-powered automation platform. The Android version uses Gemini to translate natural language commands into YAML scripts executed via Accessibility Services. I'm now building a desktop version using MCP servers with support for Hindi language input.

**[RavynOS / Swift on FreeBSD](https://ravynos.com/)** — Contributing to the effort of bringing Swift 6 to FreeBSD as part of the RavynOS project, working toward a macOS-compatible open source operating system.

**SaberStat** — An Apple Watch app for lightsaber dueling that uses IMU sensors for hit detection. Still refining the signal processing for acceleration magnitude and peak finding.

## Professional

Projects I have contributed to professionally.

* [STORMM](https://stormm.psithera.com): Structure and TOpology Replica Molecular Mechanics.

## Research-based Products

These are products that were part of some research/academic undertaking.

* [tra86](https://tra86.skushagra.com/): The Assembly Level Programming Language Tracer Analyzer
* [ASSERT](https://suobset.github.io/assert): AI Supported Smart Electricity Restoration Tool ([More details here](https://github.com/suobset/assert))
* [The Cost of Control](https://suobset.github.io/iCons3/): A simulation to optimize HVAC Controllers to work in a way which maximizes energy savings and maintains occupant comfort.
* [MBTA Accessibility Blobs](https://github.com/suobset/iCons2-MoS?tab=readme-ov-file): Interactive website, which includes a "Blob map" will help users look through the accessibility for public transit at every location in Boston. Accompanied by a research paper + video.
* [Misc. iCons Projects (Archived)](https://suobset.github.io/archive/web_v3/docs/undergraduate/icons): Other iCons related projects on my archived website not mentioned here.
* [Misc. UMass CICS Projects (Archived)](https://suobset.github.io/archive/web_v3/docs/undergraduate/CICS): Other UMass CompSci projects on my archived website not mentioned here.

## Hobby Dev

* [AptPoint](https://suobset.github.io/aptPoint): simple web app that I created to pinpoint multiple locations on a map using Leaflet and OpenStreetMap address lookup. [Read More](https://suobset.github.io/archive/web_v3/docs/independent/aptPoint)
* [Scripting Shenanigans](https://suobset.github.io/archive/web_v3/docs/independent/scripting-shenanigans): Old archive of various scripts that I plan to revive on this website.

## Hackathons

Some hackathon projects.

* [DataFest 2023](https://github.com/suobset/model-mavericks/)

Won "Best in show" (1st place) in the [ASA Five College DataFest](https://www.science.smith.edu/datafest/page/3/). Collaborated in a team of 6 (Clara Li, Nikki Lin, Quinn White, Rose Porta, Kushagra Srivastava) to create an analysis of consumer data provided by a certain legal firm. We had a 3-fold approach, wherein I contributed towards the text wrangling/NLP stuff.

This was the first ASA Five-College DataFest team which was inter-college (Smith College and UMass Amherst). We were able to synthesize our university's main teaching aspects into our final product, thus making it an inter-disciplinary win :)

Without giving away to much data due to its sensitive nature (we had to sign a contract): we essentially received a relative database wherein communications between consumers and a legal firm were recorded, along with other details on consumer actions with the firm. We were to analyze this data and determine how to equip people employed to better serve the consumer needs.

* [MoodMusic](https://github.com/suobset/MoodMusic): Using your Spotify Data to predict the mood of your songs. [Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QDSUwycH-MI).
* [DermSafe](https://github.com/suobset/hackUmass-VIII-proj-DermSafe): Android application that helps people with various skin-related health diseases identify the same and act upon it as soon as possible.
