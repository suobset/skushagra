# Temp. Archive

An archive of different things in the various sections. This space is only temporary until I get these things in their relevant positions. 

<hr />

The following was under ```Ongoing``` until June 2024. 

## UMass Amherst Manning CICS

I am currently an undergraduate Computer Science major in [UMass CICS](https://cics.umass.edu). I am also a multidisciplinary honors student in the [Commonwealth Honors College](https://www.umass.edu/honors/).

### tra86: CICS Honors Thesis

Currently working with Prof. Joe Chiu and Prof. Tim Richards from UMass CICS on my Honors Thesis. I have put a short poster on the project hypothesis below, but obviously not all data is recorded because this is an ongoing project. Moreover, the poster is about 6 months old and a lot has changed in the project (focused on Clang, Cargo, and LLVM). 

Regardless, the poster still gives a good idea of what to expect, without giving compromising details, and thus I'll leave it here. Also, there is a [git repository](https://github.com/cics-syslab/RUST-tracing-tool) which stays private for the forseeable future :)

As part of my thesis on comparing RUST and C++ Performance Metrics, I developed a whole range of scripts that would take a C++/RUST Project, Compile to Assembly, Assemble to Object File with Debugging Symbols, Link Header Files, Pass to GDB, and Trace Asm Calls as the program executes. After the tracing, it passes the trace output to another script for analyzing CPU performance.

Currently, this is only C++/RUST based and on the x86 platform. I am expanding this, since I believe that this could be extended for comparisons between any programming languages (or most). I also plan to create a UI for the whole thing allowing others to be able to use and contribute towards this project.

More details to be noted in my thesis, and at [https://tra86.skushagra.com](https://tra86.skushagra.com). Genuinely super excited to get this out in the world, this is my magnum opus currently: 

## Smith College

Currently working as a Software Dev. and System Specialist at [LinKaGe Lab](https://linkage.cs.umass.edu/) in Smith College. 

- Assisting in the Software Development part of the current research under the guidance of Dr. Ileana Streinu at the LinKaGe Lab. 

- Optimizing systems and server-side code to ensure the lab's software works efficiently, as well as ensuring upkeep and security.

- Porting legacy software to modern frameworks.

## UMass Integrated Concentration in Sciences (iCons)

### iCons 4: Spring

For the spring semester of iCons 4, I am working on bringing my Honors Thesis to a larger audience, as well as reflecting on and giving feedback to the iCons program as a whole. I have spoken at MassURC, and will be speaking at the iCons Senior Expo as an Honorary Lecturer. 

The endeavor in itself is very low-key, but I love seeing my (and everyone else's) work come to a culmination.
