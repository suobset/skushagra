# Finechive Code Projects

About Code Projects listed here vs. listed under the [Research](/docs/category/research) tab.

In the Finechive, the only code projects I am going to write about and upload are the ones that I am doing on my own time, without any affiliation to any institutions or competitions. Basically, these are completely self driven projects, with no "prize" or reason behind, except self-satisfaction.

**Crucially**, this means that the Finechive **does not contain an exhaustive list of all my projects**. Undergraduate projects, and Work Experiences are in their respective tabs. 

Here is the list of Finechive Hobby Programming Projects:

* [SaberStat](./saberstat): Live LightSaber Battle Hits/Miss Counter
* [MorbiOS](./morbios): RISC-V Operating System (under development)
* [Apartment Pointer](./aptPoint): Quick Web App to pinpoint different locations on a map.
* [Scripting Shenanigans](./scripting-shenanigans): Random (mainly Python) Scripts to do a whole bunch of things

My other projects, such as Hackathons/Thesis Projects/Class Projects/Professional Work is listed under my website's [Research](https://skushagra.com/docs/category/research) section.
