# Finechive Code Projects

About Code Projects listed here vs. listed under the [Research](/docs/category/research) tab.

In the Finechive, the only code projects I am going to write about and upload are the ones that I am doing on my own time, without any affiliation to any institutions or competitions. Basically, these are completely self driven projects, with no "prize" or reason behind, except self-satisfaction.

**Crucially**, this means that the Finechive **does not contain an exhaustive list of all my projects**.
