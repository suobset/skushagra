# Table of Contents

Since this is a wiki inside of a wiki, I felt that it would be a nice to maintain a table of contents, such that everything can be organized into relevant subheadings. 

## Meta

Stuff on the Finechive itself:

* [Preface](./preface): small paragraph on what this space is about
* [Table of Contents](./contents) (it's recursive self-loopin' time)
* [Now](./now): current ambitions, and stuff that I'm up to
* [Blog](./blog): Uncategorized, non-wiki, bursts of ideas, and everything else
* [FC Code Projects](./code-projects): **Disclaimer** on code projects that I upload here, vs. under the [Research](/docs/category/research) tab of this website. 

## Creative

Any forms of creative outlets. 

* [Photography](./photography): pictures I've taken :D
* [Scripting Shenanigans](./scripting-shenanigans): Random (mainly Python) Scripts to do a whole bunch of things

### Code/Creative

Intersection of Code and Creative Stuff

* [SaberStat](./saberstat): Live LightSaber Battle Hits/Miss Counter
* [MorbiOS](./morbios): RISC-V Operating System (under development)

## Workflow

Stuff that I use and do to get stuff done

* [Software Config](./tech-config): Software I use
