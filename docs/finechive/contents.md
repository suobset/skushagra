# Table of Contents

Since this is a wiki inside of a wiki, I felt that it would be a nice to maintain a table of centents, such that everything can be organized into relevant subheadings. 

## Meta

Stuff on the Finechive itself:

* [Preface](./preface): small paragraph on what this space is about
* [Table of Contents](./contents) (it's recursive self-loopin' time)
* [Now](./now): current ambitions, and stuff that I'm up to
* [Blog](./blog): Uncategorized, non-wiki, bursts of ideas, and everything else

## Creative

Any forms of creative outlets. 

* [Photography](./photography): pictures I've taken :D
