# Now

A space to jot down what I am up to currently. Think of it as a mini-journal/todo notes space :)

## November 21, 2023

I am currently working on 3 major facets of my life:

1. Grad School Applications: I want to conduct a MS/PhD in Computer Science, specifically in Operating Systems and Programming Languages. 
2. Undergraduate Honors Thesis: Comparing RUST and C++ Performance Metrics
3. The Opportunity Project with the Dept of Energy

I have been trying to express more creativity and nurture an artistic side to myself. While my firm belief of code being an art form stands, I have also been indulging in Photography for a while. Most pictures are uploaded to [Flickr](https://flickr.com/photos/suobset), but I plan to move away from that platform and create a photo gallery under the Finechive.
