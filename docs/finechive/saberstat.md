# SaberStat

Currently under development: watchOS and iOS app to measure hits/misses during a lightsaber match. 

Personally, I stand firm to the belief of [GPL'ing everything](/disclaimer_fsf). However, given the idea, and the tools at my disposal, creating an Apple Watch app and licensing it under MIT is the best step forward.

Please contact me if there is an open platform for a watch with accelerometers, gyroscopes, and a microphone.
