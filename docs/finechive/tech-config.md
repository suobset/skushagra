# Software Config

This is a repository of all software I use, hopefully with reasoning behind them. 

I am a firm believer in free/libre and open source, but especially free/libre software. Keep in mind, free does not refer to "free of cost", but rather to the notion of providing users the freedom to truly own what they pay for. I follow the Free Software Foundation's definition of Free/Libre Software, and my thoughts+ these freedoms are linked [here](/disclaimer_fsf).

Sometimes, I do have to resort to some proprietary software. In that case, I either look for an equivalent open-source alternative, try to see if a Linux version of that proprietary software exists, or (as a last resort) just use Windows. I do use iOS on the mobile end of things, mainly because the ubiquitous nature of iMessage in the U.S. and the health features of the Apple Watch.

## Operating System

On the stable "I-want-stuff-to-work" end of things, I have been a devout [Debian](https://debian.org) GNU/Linux user for the longest time now. I dabbled into Pop!_OS for a bit, but Debian feels more stable and refined. Moreover, I spend most of my time in the terminal.

I tinker a lot with [Trisquel](https://trisquel.org), a fully-free (as in freedom) Operating System. I have broken it, repaired it, changed the source code in bad ways...almost everything imaginable. 

Windows is a fallback, and also the only stable OS on a Microsoft Surface. Though, it only acts as a host for a Debian WSL as of now.

[Alpine](https://alpine.org) has my heart as a no-nonsense small OS. It runs beautifully on any hardware I have tried it on.

## Code Editors

Sorted by frequency: high to low | I live in the CLI mostly so this is like 80% Vim and 20% everything else :')

* Neovim: a fork of vim with extended plugin support, and a more suistainable development model. 
^ Spyder & Jupyter: Scientific computing in Python, having a variable explorer and data-exploration based features help a lot.
* VSCode: Good extension market, has a vim plugin; I was on VSCodium up until very recently, need VSCode for Tunnels (more secure, and less fuzzy SSH alternative)
* JetBrains: Rare, but super complex projects have really benefitted from the strong debugger, language-oriented IDEs, and refactoring capabilities. 
* RStudio: I have a total of 2 projects on R. RStudio is really powerful for what it does, and has a genuinely very shallow learning curve (at least relatively). Good editor, I am just not the target demographic.

## Languages

I do low level systems stuff mainly. I am highly familiar with GNU CoreUtils, and the GDB debugger. I love Valgrind as well, the stack traces and memory visualizations are honestly a godsend. I mainly use C++, though am opening up to RUST as well.

As mentioned in [Scriting Shenanigans](./scripting-shenanigans), Python is my go to for any scripts or hobby programs.

I used to code for Android, but have stopped doing so lately. 

Apart from that, I mainly do Web Dev as a means for end-user application dev (such as [ASSERT](https://suobset.github.io/assert), or this website). I have experience with PHP, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Node, React, SQL and MongoDB, Flask, and continuously keep learning new technologies. I love the web due to its open nature, and the ability to adapt to any system regardless.
