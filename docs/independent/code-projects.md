About Code Projects listed here vs. listed under the [Undergraduate](/docs/category/undergraduate) tab or rest of the site.

In the Finechive, the only code projects I am going to write about and upload are the ones that I am doing on my own time, without any affiliation to any institutions or competitions. Basically, these are completely self driven projects, with no "prize" or reason behind, except self-satisfaction.

**Crucially**, this means that the Finechive **does not contain an exhaustive list of all my projects**. Undergraduate projects, and Work Experiences are in their respective tabs. 

**Moreover**, this list is currently not exhaustive. As of 2024, most of even my hobby projects are under the "Undergraduate" tab of this website (because I also did them in relation to a CICS thing), or maybe still in my GitHub. I encourage looking around other tabs in the sidebar, and my GitHub as well, for a list of my projects that define the range of interests I have :)

Here is the list of Finechive Hobby Programming Projects:

* [SaberStat](./saberstat): Live LightSaber Battle Hits/Miss Counter
* [MorbiOS](./morbios): RISC-V Operating System (under development)
* [Apartment Pointer](./aptPoint): Quick Web App to pinpoint different locations on a map.
* [Scripting Shenanigans](./scripting-shenanigans): Random (mainly Python) Scripts to do a whole bunch of things
* [Classic Mac OS](./classicMac.md): Creating a framework to port/develop modern apps on an older OS.
* [HackThisSite.org](https://www.hackthissite.org/user/view/k-u-sh/): Sometimes my coding mind is inactive, but my tinkering mind is active. I crack cybersec puzzles on this site during those days. (will probably make a dedicated page in the sidebar soon)

My other projects, such as Hackathons/Thesis Projects/Class Projects/Professional Work is listed under my website's [Undergraduate](https://skushagra.com/docs/category/undergraduate) section.
