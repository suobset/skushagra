## Career

I will be writing on LinkedIn and ORCiD to collate my work related things. GitHub, while listed here, will also be mainly used for hobby related stuff. I had a GitLab and Codeberg as alternates to GitHub, but never found a use for them all that much. I had a replit for a while; great service, but seldom used once I got a more powerful computer (and GitHub Codespaces became a thing).

As of Feb 16, 2025: both the ORCiD and LinkedIn have been updated. The only things not included in my publications are my ongoing work at Psivant.

## Photography & Microblogging

I started my photography journey with VSCO and Flickr: both platforms that I believe have huge potential and a misguided user base. On the side, I used Instagram as well (a second account).

For microblogging, my most active front used to be Threads (which will probably remain the case for a while more, moving forward). I do not use Twitter almost at all (except for catching up on news, for which X now require you to have an account), but I will leave in a link for anyone interested.

Here's where Bluesky comes in, moving forward. Bluesky's Atmosphere Protocol is amazing for two big reasons for me:

1. Open Source
2. Lets you use your own domain for accounts

I have two main accounts on Bluesky:

* [@skushagra.com](https://bsky.app/skushagra.com): My main account for everything
* [@photos.skushagra.com](https://bsky.app/photos.skushagra.com): The **sole account** for my photography content moving forward. Flickr, VSCO are existing briefly for archival purposes as I migrate everything to Bsky. I have already deleted the photography Instagram account.

### Misc Photo and Microblog

For videos, I have had a YouTube account active for a while. [For now, it exists](https://www.youtube.com/@suobset). I do not think I will necessarily move it to bsky. The videos are sporadic, and not a sure-shot place for anything really.

## Social Media and Misc
