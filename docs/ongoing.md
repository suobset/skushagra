# Ongoing

This page holds all my ongoing projects and endeavours. Primarily, the heirarchy will be divided into different institutions of affiliation, in no particular order. This will be the forever evolving page, and projects that are over will be placed in their respective pages (or new pages will be created) in the sidebar.

## Psivant Therapeutics 

I am moving to Boston to work for Psivant Therapeutics as a Software/Systems Developer Intern. Specifically, I will be working on High Performance Computing frameworks such as [STORMM](https://github.com/psivant/stormm).

My introduction to Psivant was thanks to Prof. Scott Auerbach, and it seems that my skill-set in Systems ([tra86](https://tra86.skushagra.com/) and the rest) are a perfect fit to the work at Psivant. I will not delve into it further as of just yet, but what it essentially means is that I am pursuing the biggest jump in my career possible.

Facilitating the same, I will be moving to Boston for at least the duration of the summer, possibly beyond.

## Misc. Projects

This section holds personal projects: anything that I am investing time in, but for the pursuit of knowledge and self-fulfillment/happiness/mainly because programming is my hobby as well. 

Projects mentioned are outside of the regular stuff that maintainance of this site entails, and the [Blog](/blog) that I am writing on this site as well. The projects below are some that I have been doing/wanted to do for a very long time now, and I just find them interesting.

I will probably keep writing about these, amongst other things, on the aforementioned blog still.

### Official

These are the subset that are not just hobby-related, but actually help someone else or are official (just not directly under CICS affiliation).

#### Anna Biondo's Low Carbon Concrete Project

A first for me: but I (and [Anvitha Ramachandran](https://github.com/anvitha305) of iCons) are currently working with [Anna Biondo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anna-biondo-2024/) (iCons) to create a video game for her Low Carbon Concrete Project. Part of a bigger project posted [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7176237788382515200/), Anna served as a Project Intern for Boston Society for Architecture and helped create a report that details the obstacles and opportunities for decarbonizing concrete production.

### Hobby

#### MorbiOS

MorbiOS is a currently under-development RUST-based Operating System that Anvitha and I are developing, half as a joke and half to teach ourselves more in-depth about different Operating System paradigms and how does one even go about creating one. While we both have extensive Systems experience, them having created a [legv8sim](https://github.com/anvitha305/legv8sim) for their thesis and me having compared different programming languages on a low-level baseline, we both believe that this project would provide an immense learning opportunity that classes sometimes do not have time for. And above all, this is a hobby: we actually love doing this stuff.

While there is not much out there: be on the lookout [here](https://skushagra.com/docs/independent/morbios) for more updates to the project as they keep on coming. 

#### Classic MacOS

For a while now, I have been attempting to create a framework that allows developers to either backport, or create new modern application on Mac OS 9 (the pre UNIX Mac that was kind of failing). This is mainly an exercise in learning about the limitations and eccentricities of the turn-of-the-century OS.
