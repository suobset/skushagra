# iCons

This is a repository to hold all Research Work I have done under the <b>Integrated Concentration in Science (iCons)</b> Program along with the College of Natural Sciences at University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

### UPDATES

#### April 2024

* Added The US Census Opportunity Project Files, data regarding [ASSERT](https://suobset.github.io/assert).

The following is pertaining to iCons 4, which is not on the innovation portal. 

##### iCons 4

iCons 4 is a supplementary class that follows the same timeline as the Honors Thesis. The main aim is to communicate about your project to a non-scientific audience first, and then to a scientific audience in the second half. We use a digital medium to communicate the importance of the project, expectations, and how this may help the end user. 

I plan to create a website for the same, but do not know much yet. Updates will be added as they unfold. 

[Link to project](https://suobset.github.io/iCons/iCons4). As of October 9, 2023, it houses a dummy Docusaurus init template website.

#### September 2023

The default for [https://suobset.github.io/iCons](https://suobset.github.io/iCons) has been moved to this page. All iCons projects, however, remain under their respective domains so as to not break any links (on ORCiD, UMass iCons Innovation Portal, and this list). 

The monorepo for my iCons projects remains [GH/suobset/iCons](https://github/suobset/iCons) with refs to other repositories for single projects in the monorepo itself, or this webpage.

Moreover, ongoing projects are now linked under the aptly-named [Ongoing Projects](https://skushagra.com/docs/research/ongoing) page in the website.

## Innovation Portal + Formal List of Projects 

All of these projects can be found in the <a href="https://icons.cns.umass.edu/innovation-portal/search">Official UMass iCons Innovation Portal</a>. The ```Official UMass Entry``` <b>link under each project in this page is the actual published link of the project</b>, and should be used primarily to refer to the same.

This page mainly serves as a means to collate all my projects and those links in one place, as well as give some extra resources for each project. Projects under this page are compiled in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

### U.S. Census: The Opportunity Project (ASSERT)

[The Opportunity Project](https://opportunity.census.gov/) is a unique research endeavour by the [Census Open Innovation Labs](https://coil.census.gov/) which prompts different universities to come up with digital tools built with the help of open government data. Students in each team are paired with industry experts, and follow a range of milestones [as described here](https://opportunity.census.gov/our-process/). The final product is digital (website, app, visualizations, etc.) aimed at different industry experts, which in-turn would help them solve the issue at hand.

Currently collaborating with a team of 6 (Suhani Chawla, Sarojini Torchon, Anvitha Ramachandran, Gabrielle Walczak, Jose Cruz, and I) on a dataset provided by the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://energy.gov/) to improve energy access in minority households.

[Featured in UMass Amherst News](https://www.umass.edu/news/article/us-census-bureau-recruits-umass-icons-program-students-work-equitable-access)

Our project, the AI Supported Smart Electricity Restoration Tool ([ASSERT](https://suobset.github.io/assert/)) aims to add a lens of power outage overburden and vulnerability to the utility emergency responseâ€™s repair and restoration decision-making pipeline. This was done by identified key metrics that predict power overburden in counties lacking data. Additionally, we used unemployment, poverty and minority data to enhance said prediction.

The interactive map displays two layers: the actual ODIN data and the predicted ODIN data. Users can choose which layer to overlay on the map using the layer selection feature on the right side of the screen.

To select a map layer:

1. Locate the layer selection feature on the right side of the screen.
2. Choose either "Actual ODIN Data" or "Predicted ODIN Data" from the available options.

At the top of the screen, a legend provides information about the color-coded indices representing the level of overburden. The legend ranges from -10 to 10, and each color on the map corresponds to a specific overburden level. Use the legend to interpret the map and understand the intensity of overburden at different locations. Lastly, on the top left of the screen are zoom in and zoom out buttons for the convenience of the user.

#### Media Updates

This project has apparently garnered a lot of traction across various UMass websites. Here is a record of all of them:

* [UMass News](https://www.umass.edu/news/article/us-census-bureau-recruits-umass-icons-program-students-work-equitable-access)
* [UMass College of Natural Sciences](https://icons.cns.umass.edu/news-events/news/us-census-bureau-topteam)
* [UMass Manning CICS + CICS Highlights](https://www.cics.umass.edu/news/us-census-bureau-recruits-cics-students-work-equitable-access-electrical-power)
* [U.S. Census Department](https://opportunity.census.gov/showcase/?year=2023&partner-agency=Department+of+Energy) (look for ASSERT in the filter)

### iCons 3: The Cost of Control

iCons 3 entailed a group lab project wherein data was to be taken from the real world and carefully analyzed to come to a conclusion. Lab work becomes the emphasis in iCons 3, and the team (Anvitha, Emily, Frank, and I) decided to create a simulation which would help us implement methods to optimize HVAC Controllers to work in a way which maximizes energy savings and maintains occupant comfort.

Special thanks to [these folks](https://suobset.github.io/iCons3/docs/acknowledgements_references) who were instrumental in us completing this project with valuable insights.

Visit Project Website for Simulation, Details, and the Report + Insights: https://suobset.github.io/iCons3

The project uses one monorepo separate from the ```suobset/iCons``` monorepo:

* [GH/suobset/iCons3](https://github.com/suobset/iCons3) contains all code for everything: Website + Simulation
* [GH/suobset/iCons/iCons3-CS1](https://github.com/iCons) contains ONLY assets. Not much of value.

Project not yet up on iCons Innovation Portal.

### iCons 2: Museum of Science

A group project to map the Boston T and judge it's accessibility. The project uses two repositories:

* ```suobset/iCons2-MoS``` for R data, GIS data, manipulation, creation, and literally almost everything
* "iCons2-MoS" subfolder of this current parent repository, only to export ```suobset/iCons2-MoS``` as a webpage and host it on GitHub Pages. Alternatively, <a href="https://github.com/suobset/iCons/iCons2-MoS">Click Here</a>.

### iCons 1: Case Study 2 (Team 6 Hydrogen Viewer)

A website which was created as an extension to our Poster. Our Research was "Filling in gap of ways to make Hydrogen Energy more Accessible and Reliable". The website was created as an interactive means for the audience to view the data and the future scope of the project. 

The main poster along with the research data and the sources can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rl3o4Oow5fyl0XPS_FKG08Z8-gC7tRm8D_qi6X6LMBE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> (and on the [project website](https://suobset.github.io/iCons/iCons1-CS2/) as of September 2023). The website was created as a companion to go alongside said poster. The link was given to all before the presentation, and the audience could play around with the website while listening about our research.
