# iCons

This is a repository to hold all Research Work I have done under the <b>Integrated Concentration in Science (iCons)</b> Program along with the College of Natural Sciences at University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

### UPDATES

#### September 2023

The default for [https://suobset.github.io/iCons](https://suobset.github.io/iCons) has been moved to this page. All iCons projects, however, remain under their respective domains so as to not break any links (on ORCiD, UMass iCons Innovation Portal, and this list). 

The monorepo for my iCons projects remains [GH/suobset/iCons](https://github/suobset/iCons) with refs to other repositories for single projects in the monorepo itself, or this webpage.

Moreover, ongoing projects are now linked under the aptly-named [Ongoing Projects](../research/ongoing) page in the website.

## Innovation Portal + Formal List of Projects 

All of these projects can be found in the <a href="https://icons.cns.umass.edu/innovation-portal/search">Official UMass iCons Innovation Portal</a>. The ```Official UMass Entry``` <b>link under each project in this page is the actual published link of the project</b>, and should be used primarily to refer to the same.

This page mainly serves as a means to collate all my projects and those links in one place, as well as give some extra resources for each project. Projects under this page are compiled in reverse chronological order (most recent first).

### iCons 3: The Cost of Control

iCons 3 entailed a group lab project wherein data was to be taken from the real world and carefully analyzed to come to a conclusion. Lab work becomes the emphasis in iCons 3, and the team (Anvitha, Emily, Frank, and I) decided to create a simulation which would help us implement methods to optimize HVAC Controllers to work in a way which maximizes energy savings and maintains occupant comfort.

Special thanks to [these folks](https://suobset.github.io/iCons3/docs/acknowledgements_references) who were instrumental in us completing this project with valuable insights.

Visit Project Website for Simulation, Details, and the Report + Insights: https://suobset.github.io/iCons3

The project uses one monorepo separate from the ```suobset/iCons``` monorepo:

* [GH/suobset/iCons3](https://github.com/suobset/iCons3) contains all code for everything: Website + Simulation
* [GH/suobset/iCons/iCons3-CS1](https://github.com/iCons) contains ONLY assets. Not much of value.

Project not yet up on iCons Innovation Portal.

### iCons 2: Museum of Science

A group project to map the Boston T and judge it's accessibility. The project uses two repositories:

* ```suobset/iCons2-MoS``` for R data, GIS data, manipulation, creation, and literally almost everything
* "iCons2-MoS" subfolder of this current parent repository, only to export ```suobset/iCons2-MoS``` as a webpage and host it on GitHub Pages. Alternatively, <a href="https://github.com/suobset/iCons/iCons2-MoS">Click Here</a>.

### iCons 1: Case Study 2 (Team 6 Hydrogen Viewer)

A website which was created as an extension to our Poster. Our Research was "Filling in gap of ways to make Hydrogen Energy more Accessible and Reliable". The website was created as an interactive means for the audience to view the data and the future scope of the project. 

The main poster along with the research data and the sources can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rl3o4Oow5fyl0XPS_FKG08Z8-gC7tRm8D_qi6X6LMBE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a> (and on the [project website](https://suobset.github.io/iCons/iCons1-CS2/) as of September 2023). The website was created as a companion to go alongside said poster. The link was given to all before the presentation, and the audience could play around with the website while listening about our research.
