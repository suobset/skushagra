# Ongoing

This page holds all my ongoing projects and endeavours. Primarily, the heirarchy will be divided into different institutions of affiliation, in no particular order. This will be the forever evolving page, and projects that are over will be placed in their respective pages (or new pages will be created) in the sidebar.

## UMass Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS)

I am currently an undergraduate Computer Science major in [UMass CICS](https://cics.umass.edu). I am also a multidisciplinary honors student in the [Commonwealth Honors College](https://www.umass.edu/honors/).

### CICS Honors Thesis

Currently working with Prof. Joe Chiu and Prof. Tim Richards from UMass CICS on my Honors Thesis. I have put a short poster on the project hypothesis below, but obviously not all data is recorded because this is an ongoing project. Moreover, the poster is about 6 months old and a lot has changed in the project (focused on Clang, Cargo, and LLVM). 

Regardless, the poster still gives a good idea of what to expect, without giving compromising details, and thus I'll leave it here. Also, there is a [git repository](https://github.com/cics-syslab/RUST-tracing-tool) which stays private for the forseeable future :)

### CICS SysLab

As part of conducting the Honors Thesis research in an interactive way, and facilitating more Systems research on campus, I am also a member of the newly created CICS SysLab (website soon) by Prof. Joe Chiu and Prof. Tim Richards. Here's the first meeting, held Spring 2023:

## UMass Integrated Concentration in Sciences (iCons)

### U.S. Census: The Opportunity Project

[The Opportunity Project](https://opportunity.census.gov/) is a unique research endeavour by the [Census Open Innovation Labs](https://coil.census.gov/) which prompts different universities to come up with digital tools built with the help of open government data. Students in each team are paired with industry experts, and follow a range of milestones [as described here](https://opportunity.census.gov/our-process/). The final product is digital (website, app, visualizations, etc.) aimed at different industry experts, which in-turn would help them solve the issue at hand.

Currently collaborating with a team of 6 (Suhani Chawla, Sarojini Torchon, Anvitha Ramachandran, Gabrielle Walczak, Jose Cruz, and I) on a dataset provided by the [U.S. Department of Energy](https://energy.gov/) to improve energy access in minority households.

### iCons 4

iCons 4 is a supplementary class that follows the same timeline as the Honors Thesis. The main aim is to communicate about your project to a non-scientific audience first, and then to a scientific audience in the second half. We use a digital medium to communicate the importance of the project, expectations, and how this may help the end user. 

I plan to create a website for the same, but do not know much yet. Details will be added as they unfold. 

## Smith College

### LinKaGe Lab

Currently working as a Software Dev. and System Specialist at [LinKaGe Lab](https://linkage.cs.umass.edu/) in Smith College. 

- Assisting in the Software Development part of the current research under the guidance of Dr. Ileana Streinu at the LinKaGe Lab. 

- Optimizing systems and server-side code to ensure the lab's software works efficiently, as well as ensuring upkeep and security.

- Porting legacy software to modern frameworks.
