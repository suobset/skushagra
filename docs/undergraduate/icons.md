# iCons

All iCons research projects, including digital products.

This is a repository to hold all Research Work I have done under the <b>Integrated Concentration in Science (iCons)</b> Program along with the College of Natural Sciences at University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

## Innovation Portal + Formal List of Projects 

All of these projects can be found in the <a href="https://icons.cns.umass.edu/innovation-portal/search">Official UMass iCons Innovation Portal</a>. The ```Official UMass Entry``` <b>link under each project in this page is the actual published link of the project</b>, and should be used primarily to refer to the same.

## iCons 4

For the spring semester of iCons 4, I am working on bringing my Honors Thesis to a larger audience, as well as reflecting on and giving feedback to the iCons program as a whole. I have spoken at MassURC, and will be speaking at the iCons Senior Expo as an Honorary Lecturer. 

The endeavor in itself is very low-key, but I love seeing my (and everyone else's) work come to a culmination. 

[Thesis Website Created for iCons 4](https://tra86.skushagra.com), which then became the overall website for the project. 

For the Senior Expo for iCons, I was invited to give a short speech regarding what my project was.

For more context, the [Honors Thesis](./tra86) page may be useful. iCons 4 was mainly concerned with getting this thesis out to a bigger audience. I was deeply honored to be giving a talk on my thesis, along with 3 other iCons scholars. 

I will be uploading that talk as soon as I get my hands on it :)
