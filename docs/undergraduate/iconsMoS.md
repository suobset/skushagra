![GIS Map](./assets/icons2mos.png)

UMass iCons 2 + Museum of Science, Boston

A group project to map the Boston T and judge it's accessibility. The project uses two repositories:

* ```suobset/iCons2-MoS``` for R data, GIS data, manipulation, creation, and literally almost everything
* "iCons2-MoS" subfolder of this current parent repository, only to export ```suobset/iCons2-MoS``` as a webpage and host it on GitHub Pages. Alternatively, <a href="https://github.com/suobset/iCons/iCons2-MoS">Click Here</a>.
