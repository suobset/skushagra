# Modified xv6

Modified and tinkered xv6 with [Prof. Tim Richards](https://www.cics.umass.edu/faculty/directory/richards_tim) and the class for the honors colloquium of 377: Operating Systems. 

xv6 is a re-implementation of Dennis Ritchie's and Ken Thompson's Unix
Version 6 (v6).  xv6 loosely follows the structure and style of v6,
but is implemented for a modern RISC-V multiprocessor using ANSI C.

The GitHub repository for the project has since been removed, as it was part of a Class Organization.
