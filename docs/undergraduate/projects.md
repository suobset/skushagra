# CICS Competitions and Other Projects

CICS Competitions & Other non-academic (but still for CICS) projects.

This is a repository to hold my projects/competitions outside of CICS. However, most of them were still done under or via my CICS affiliation.

Essentially, these are non-hobby (done for a official purpose) Projects that do not directly fall under one institution. I am counting competitions here as well.

* [HackUMass IX: MoodMusic](./moodmusic)
* [HackUMass VIII: Dermsafe](./dermsafe)
