### <a href="https://skushagra.com/">Know more about me!!!</a>

<hr>

This is a repository to hold all Research Work I have done under the <b>Integrated Concentration in Science (iCons)</b> Program along with the College of Natural Sciences at University of Massachusetts, Amherst.

All of these projects can be found in the <a href="https://icons.cns.umass.edu/innovation-portal/search">Official UMass iCons Innovation Portal</a>. The ```Official UMass Entry``` <b>link under each project in this page is the actual published link of the project</b>, and should be used primarily to refer to the same.

This page mainly serves as a means to collate all my projects and those links in one place, as well as give some extra resources for each project.

## iCons 1: Case Study 2 (Team 6 Hydrogen Viewer)

A website which was created as an extension to our Poster. Our Research was "Filling in gap of ways to make Hydrogen Energy more Accessible and Reliable". The website was created as an interactive means for the audience to view the data and the future scope of the project. 

The main poster along with the research data and the sources can be viewed <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Rl3o4Oow5fyl0XPS_FKG08Z8-gC7tRm8D_qi6X6LMBE/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. The website was created as a companion to go alongside said poster. The link was given to all before the presentation, and the audience could play around with the website while listening about our research.

## iCons 2: Museum of Science

A group project to map the Boston T and judge it's accessibility. The project uses two repositories:

* ```suobset/iCons2-MoS``` for R data, GIS data, manipulation, creation, and literally almost everything
* "iCons2-MoS" subfolder of this current parent repository, only to export ```suobset/iCons2-MoS``` as a webpage and host it on GitHub Pages. Alternatively, <a href="https://github.com/suobset/iCons/iCons2-MoS">Click Here</a>.
