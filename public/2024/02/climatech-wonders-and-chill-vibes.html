<p>Welcome to the second episode of my Newsletter, accompanied by a gorgeous picture of the UMass Amherst West Experimentation Station. I take a lot of pictures in my daily life, but most do not see the light of day, which is why I am going to attempt to merge my different art forms. The Photography page in the Finechive is still under construction, and hopefully it does not take long.</p>
<p>In today’s newsletter we take a tour of Greentown Labs (well, at least what I am allowed to show on here), discuss the issues of Open Source Collaborators having to deal with arduos amounts of people who “feel they are entitled to a .exe”, and I go over some of my own history of trying to maintain a platform such as this. Finishing off, we have some (read: one) cool thing I found on the Internet.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to visit on a personalized tour of <a href="https://greentownlabs.com/">Greentown Labs</a>: a Climatech Incubator providing resources to startups to achieve their maximum potential in developing cutting-edge solutions to combat Climate Change. They provide, essentially, lab space + funding + connections and networking to startups. They also provide legal advice to startups for licensing their IP to larger companies, and essentially do a lot of, for lack of a better term, insanely cool stuff.</p>
<p>I got an opportunity through <a href="https://icons.cns.umass.edu">UMass iCons</a> to visit the labs, and have a peek at all the amazing startups and the work being done there. From deicing airplane wings, to testing environmental structures in an indoor weather simulator; it is essentially an elevated makerspace.</p>

<p>I got the furthermore opportunity to participate in their career fair, as well as talk to some people behind the scenes. <a href="https://greentownlabs.com/members/fleet-robotics/">Fleet Robotics</a> uses roomba-like robots to clean biofuling, <a href="https://greentownlabs.com/members/de-ice/">De-Ice</a> uses electric pulses over the body of an aircraft to de-ice the airplane, and <a href="https://greentownlabs.com/members/cyvl-ai/">Cyvl.ai</a> uses Computer Vision to aid local governments in analyzing what road signs &amp; traffic equipment needs maintainance.</p>
<p>Huge shoutout to Marinna Teixeira &lsquo;16 (<a href="https://instagram.com/marinnateix">@marinnateix</a>) and Deanna Kenyon &lsquo;19 (<a href="https://instagram.com/deerosekenyon">@deerosekenyon</a>), at Greentown Labs in Somerville, MA for organizing this and graciously welcoming the 11th and 12th iCons cohorts to Greentown.</p>

<h2 id="vibin-out">Vibin’ out</h2>
<p>These months currently feel like an Academic Limbo: a place where I am a bit uncertain as to how things may be headed. I am waiting on Grad Schools, finishing up on my Honors Thesis, and writing my drafts for <a href="https://honorspaths.honors.umass.edu/massurc">MassURC</a>, on top of already being committed to academic work. Personally, I have felt that while I do have a good framework of dealing with stress, I need to realize that I am not alone, and others are in this same journey as me.</p>
<p>I have been looking at ways to destress at times, and outside of my usual hobbies of Photography + Newslettring, I have found myself surfing the web to find hidden gems. One of them is a web-based game, <a href="https://slowroads.io">slowroads.io</a>. Put on some music, and drive on an endless road (in different times of day and weather conditions).</p>
<p><a href="/images/AVvXsEi-1HwSmH2mLCyCn8HPQfbYmdYQaEoDtTlO5k-j7vWG3Qq4DuvIiUHPg_v2FnTC4wyM-ll7AuhkcWo2ero8hfkT_GNXhXuiN4oSl7tDENP095lbPLmJwk92RGnrUseHlhElUcwSwNcJCjO3So9iTntIXRhD5ehUf2K61S6eHJ1l11NS4lSrP12OE3sRp-g"><img src="/images/AVvXsEi-1HwSmH2mLCyCn8HPQfbYmdYQaEoDtTlO5k-j7vWG3Qq4DuvIiUHPg_v2FnTC4wyM-ll7AuhkcWo2ero8hfkT_GNXhXuiN4oSl7tDENP095lbPLmJwk92RGnrUseHlhElUcwSwNcJCjO3So9iTntIXRhD5ehUf2K61S6eHJ1l11NS4lSrP12OE3sRp-g=w400-h224" alt=""></a></p>
<p>Now, want some music to go along? <a href="https://poolsuite.net">Poolsuite</a> has you covered with a website inspired by old MacOS and Windows, with 90s ads playing on loop and endless mixtapes on different radio channels. It is the perfect blend of neo-retroism.</p>

<p>Poolsuite and Slowroads are not my products, and belong to their respective owners. I just loved finding out about them.</p>
<h2 id="some-finechive-updates">Some Finechive Updates</h2>
<p>Funnily enough, I have been writing blogs and online content in an on and off basis since 2017. The Finechive is also a place wherein I want to archive all my previous blogs and websites. It is a continual process, but look out at the archive (coming soon) page for more info. A quick debrief:</p>
<ul>
<li>Minded Mindlessness was the last big blog effort I ran, from 2017-2019.</li>
<li>I had a high school blog before that</li>
<li>I used this domain between 2019-2020 for teaching music.</li>
<li>I now write this newsletter here :)</li>
</ul>
<p>Finding the bits of online content here and there has been a transformative experience for myself, to say the least. Minded Mindlessness was an effort with my then-partner, and reading that especially has instilled this deep sense of appreciation of how far we come in life. I was like 16 when i wrote those. While I have matured so much more than where I was at that time, so many of my traits and perspectives on life can be traced back to the moments when I last wrote that endeavour.</p>
<p>Similarly, my interests in my field can be seen today in my first blog as well, which was such a weird endeavour. I write about some politics, AI, Machine Learning, despite just having a very novel outlook towards such things. Yet, here I am specializing in the very thing, as well as working in low-level systems (stuff that makes everything else run, computationally speaking).</p>
<p>It’s a bit beautiful, but I love looking back at life like this. Also, doesn’t hurt you to reach out and say thanks to the people in your past, even after years of disconnect. Life’s beautiful.</p>
<p>Outside of this, I think I will keep writing a mix of wacky internet stuff + personal stories and opinions on here. I’m still figuring this newsletter out, but I am excited about it’s future.</p>
<p>It can become a bit tricky at times to know the direction of a specific creative endeavour. However, for the time being I am just uploading archives of these past experiences on this website. It is all completely done, except Minded Mindlessness. I will post an edit to this space once that is done as well.</p>
