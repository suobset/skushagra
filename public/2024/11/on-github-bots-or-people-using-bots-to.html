<p>None of these accounts have much meaningful contributions to anything, outside of copy and pasted Leetcode solutions. Seriously, that is all. Between templates for generic web dev projects, Leetcode solutions, and profile readmes that read like you entered a rave in Ibiza, I have not found anything substantial. And these generic repos (which all of them have a version of) have a good amount of stars, from each other.</p>
<p>Fun.</p>
