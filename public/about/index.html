    <p>I&rsquo;m <strong>Kushagra Srivastava</strong>, a CS Masters student at Northeastern University specializing in operating systems and compilers. I build systems-level software and care deeply about how computers actually work.</p>
<h2 id="what-i-work-on">What I Work On</h2>
<p>My focus is low-level systems programming—the kind of work where you&rsquo;re thinking about memory layouts, build systems, and why something takes 40 minutes to compile when it should take 9.</p>
<p><strong>Current interests:</strong> Operating systems, compiler development, molecular dynamics simulation, LLMs as an accessibility tool, and making software that respects both the machine and the person using it.</p>
<h2 id="current-projects">Current Projects</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://psivant.com/">STORMM</a></strong> — Molecular dynamics simulation software at Psivant Therapeutics.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://tra86.skushagra.com/">tra86</a></strong> — An x86 assembly stack tracer I built for my honors thesis at UMass Amherst. The thesis compared Rust and C++ performance at the assembly level using modified GDB tracing.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/suobset/automator">SelfSelect / Automator</a></strong> — An LLM-powered automation platform. The Android version uses Gemini to translate natural language commands into YAML scripts executed via Accessibility Services. I&rsquo;m now building a desktop version using MCP servers with support for Hindi language input.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://ravynos.com/">RavynOS / Swift on FreeBSD</a></strong> — Contributing to the effort of bringing Swift 6 to FreeBSD as part of the RavynOS project, working toward a macOS-compatible open source operating system.</p>
<p><strong>SaberStat</strong> — An Apple Watch app for lightsaber dueling that uses IMU sensors for hit detection. Still refining the signal processing for acceleration magnitude and peak finding.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently pursuing my Masters in Computer Science at Northeastern University, focusing on operating systems and compilers.</p>
<p>Before this, I worked at Psivant Therapeutics as a Systems/Software Developer on STORMM, a molecular dynamics framework. That role taught me a lot about large-scale scientific software and high performance computation.</p>
<p>I studied Computer Science at UMass Amherst (BS, Honors), where my thesis compared Rust and C++ performance at the assembly level. My first Linux experience was Ubuntu on an Intel Atom netbook in 7th grade—I wrote code on underpowered hardware because that&rsquo;s what I had. That&rsquo;s probably why I care so much about efficient software now.</p>
<h2 id="interests">Interests</h2>
<p><strong>Retro computing</strong> — PowerBook G3, Acer eeePC, Macintosh System 9, SUN Solaris, and anything that makes you appreciate how far we&rsquo;ve come (or haven&rsquo;t). I own actual hardware!!</p>
<p><strong>Right-to-repair</strong> — I believe strongly that you should be able to fix what you own.</p>
<p><strong>Lightsaber battles</strong> — Seriously enough to build an Apple Watch app for it.</p>
<p>I think programming is an art form. I prefer well-crafted, platform-native software over cross-platform compromises. I&rsquo;ll take a thoughtfully designed tool over a feature-bloated one every time.</p>
<p>This site runs on <a href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a> with a custom theme I built—amber terminal aesthetics meets classic Mac typography. No JavaScript frameworks were harmed in the making of this blog.</p>
