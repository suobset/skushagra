      <title>Creativity is the Ultimate Form of Expression</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Go out and create something. Put time and effort into it. Sometimes, you may find yourself to be in a rut that is difficult to come out of. But, do create something and put your soul and effort into it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are finally in a weird late stage capitialism point wherein we have successfully monetized everything, on a rolling basis. Mediocre products are sold at exorbitant pricing, and even our sanity and emotions are being taken away from us. Social media has monetized being famous, and gives an equal voice to everyone regardless of their qualifications or backgrounds. Your value is only based on ephemeral metrics and numbers, and the joy of creating has become transformed into a dread of meeting deadlines that fulfill sponsorship contracts.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There have been quite a few times when I have talked about aesthetics, and I still believe that they are the best way to express myself. I have a &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/blog/liminal-spaces-art-of-appreciating&#34;&gt;post here from last year diving into Liminal Spaces&lt;/a&gt;, and to this day they capture the feeling of loneliness and eerieness perfectly.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A lot of the pictures I take pertain to outdoor Liminal Spaces. It is an interest that started during the Pandemic lockdowns, especially in a context where I was joining online Zoom meetings from the other corner of the globe. Going from interacting with over 15-20 people at a time on Discord to absolute silence at 4AM on the click of a button, I did not yet realize that I was living in a Liminal Space.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
