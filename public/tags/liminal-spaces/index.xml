This is a story of a particular phase of my own life, how it has been influenced by my past, and how it delves into one of my favorite aesthetics of all time. This will also be an attempt to capture my version of that aesthetic.&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/AVvXsEh1JwxXhIDeuGAKZ3DMGZ8UbWl85OQILzR7UU1Vj7GanOVUiQpAV0JnDiFte5Udvt8cnNUEpiQfrporzhkOJS3Wdy_yadBOyMHCE5fz9hdGfnfo0tWf4pneX_2YWCd_NWKJuQBaN7NNKDmKMCge6QsAoIytRAiZTfJEW0XOAt7GVmle_p9gcnacsRn12h0&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/AVvXsEh1JwxXhIDeuGAKZ3DMGZ8UbWl85OQILzR7UU1Vj7GanOVUiQpAV0JnDiFte5Udvt8cnNUEpiQfrporzhkOJS3Wdy_yadBOyMHCE5fz9hdGfnfo0tWf4pneX_2YWCd_NWKJuQBaN7NNKDmKMCge6QsAoIytRAiZTfJEW0XOAt7GVmle_p9gcnacsRn12h0=w640-h360&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The beginning of what would culminate into a series of developing multiple aspects into what my life would really turn out to be started right around the corner of me transitioning from my High School phase to my University phase; at a time when every single person on the planet was transitioning away from life as they had known into one that was being navigated in the midst of a global pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
