<p>As part of my current job, I have needed to do OS reinstalls on a frequent basis. Given that my work revolves around CUDA, here are some of the steps I follow in my workflow to get Nvidia drivers playing well in Linux.</p>

<p>I love seeing the Boston Dynamics Spot cameo in unexpected places. Over here, Chip is used for QC purposes.</p>
<p>I recently attended a livestream event from Intel Foundry (think Intel&rsquo;s hardware R&amp;D + Manufacturing wing which partners with other companies and manufactures processors), and as someone who spends a good chunk of time buried in low-level systems – delving into OSes and how compilers really work – this was pretty fascinating stuff. Seeing how the foundational layer of computing, the actual silicon manufacturing, is evolving felt directly relevant to the software I tinker with: even though I know very little in this hardware domain.</p>

<p>The following is one of possibly many posts I’ll be using to consolidate contributions to LinkedIn’s Quora-esque <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/topics/home/">collaborative articles</a> wherein contributors can answer questions and respond to/upvote other answers. I really like the feature, especially the fact that each contribution is capped to 750 characters (so no redundancy).</p>
<p>For some questions, I have added footnotes that go beyond my 750 character contribution to the topic itself. I appreciate that I can tell my initial thoughts on LinkedIn, and expand upon them here.</p>

            <p>One of the more infuriariting things I have come across on the GitHub platform is people using bots to mass follow other people, in hopes for a follow back (or more importantly, some stars and forks on their projects).</p>
<p>However, when unreciprocated with a follow and some stars, their main goal is to unfollow and refollow, thus coming on the top of my timeline again.</p>
<p>They keep this up for a very long period of times, sometimes almost thrice a week for 2 months.</p>

<p>The following series (which is separate from my newsletter), is going to be a comprehensive deep dive into programming for Mac OS version 9: the ancient pre-UNIX version of the Operating System which barely has much documentation on the Internet today. This post is mainly initialization, I just got the VM working and a pipeline to install 3rd party (old) software :)</p>
<p>I do not exactly have a plan in mind, but I hope to be able to share the “why”, and possibly the “how”, in this blog post. I have always been interested in vintage computing, having dabbled with Windows 3.1 in High School for kicks and giggles, to having just completed my Undergraduate Honors Thesis on comparing performance differences between 2 programming languages on the Assembly level. To me, working through the difficulties of programming and figuring out this puzzle is the fun bit in of itself, and what better platform to take than one that shares very little resemblance to any modern OS (Win 9x uses the Windows API which is still used today, and recent macOS is UNIX based).</p>

<p><a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/">The Opportunity Project</a> is a unique research endeavour by the <a href="https://coil.census.gov/">Census Open Innovation Labs</a> which prompts different universities to come up with digital tools built with the help of open government data. Students in each team are paired with industry experts, and follow a range of milestones <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/our-process/">as described here</a>. The final product is digital (website, app, visualizations, etc.) aimed at different industry experts, which in-turn would help them solve the issue at hand.</p>

<p>Slightly late blog update this week, owing mainly to the amounts of midterms and the thesis progress that had to be made last week. However, we are back and kicking: and I hope that I will be able to keep this momentum up next week as well. In today’s newsletter, I would love to highlight some fun code I wrote for my Honors Thesis last semester.</p>
<p>The banner for this newsletter was taken on my trip to Washington D.C. Fall 2023, during the U.S. Census Department’s Justice Week Event. I was one of the 6 people who worked on <a href="https://suobset.github.io/assert">ASSERT</a>, a GIS Web-App that directs emergency responders (like Eversource, National Grid) to counties that are more vulnerable to energy inequity. A lot of data processing and web development later, we were able to successfully demo our product, which earnwed us a spot on the Census Department’s <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/showcase/?year=2023&amp;partner-agency=Department+of+Energy">website</a>.</p>

<p>This newsletter is a special one to me: it is the third week that I am writing something down on this platform without fail, and thus building up the momentum to continue doing the same for a longer period of time. The issues that come with scheduling problems, or a general lack of motivation towards doing something start to dwindle by the time it is the third week of committing to a new habit.</p>

<p>Welcome to the second episode of my Newsletter, accompanied by a gorgeous picture of the UMass Amherst West Experimentation Station. I take a lot of pictures in my daily life, but most do not see the light of day, which is why I am going to attempt to merge my different art forms. The Photography page in the Finechive is still under construction, and hopefully it does not take long.</p>

            <h2></h2>
<p>There have been quite a few times when I have talked about aesthetics, and I still believe that they are the best way to express myself. I have a <a href="/blog/liminal-spaces-art-of-appreciating">post here from last year diving into Liminal Spaces</a>, and to this day they capture the feeling of loneliness and eerieness perfectly.</p>
<p>A lot of the pictures I take pertain to outdoor Liminal Spaces. It is an interest that started during the Pandemic lockdowns, especially in a context where I was joining online Zoom meetings from the other corner of the globe. Going from interacting with over 15-20 people at a time on Discord to absolute silence at 4AM on the click of a button, I did not yet realize that I was living in a Liminal Space.</p>
