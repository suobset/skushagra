<p><em>Update: Automator, the codebase I started making here, now has a public dev repo. I&rsquo;ll be working more on it and update it on this Blog + a couple other forums as determined. <a href="https://github.com/suobset/automator">Check it out!</a></em></p>

</ul>
<p>As a developer, I would like to showcase herein <strong>how to best use AI to help teach yourself development for a platform you have never laid your hands on</strong>. I do compilers and low level systems; in this article, I will be making a minimal prototype Android app that uses a LLM-like interface to help you navigate your phone. For the sake of brevity, I have only documented what I did on the first couple days of this project, as I figure and polish the app further for a proper OSS release.</p>

<p>The following is one of possibly many posts I’ll be using to consolidate contributions to LinkedIn’s Quora-esque <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/topics/home/">collaborative articles</a> wherein contributors can answer questions and respond to/upvote other answers. I really like the feature, especially the fact that each contribution is capped to 750 characters (so no redundancy).</p>
<p>For some questions, I have added footnotes that go beyond my 750 character contribution to the topic itself. I appreciate that I can tell my initial thoughts on LinkedIn, and expand upon them here.</p>

<p>I recently needed a Virtual Machine to containerize some work. Initially, I was on a Debian VM. However, as much as I love Linux, I ran into a couple of issues there:</p>
<ol>
<li>I use Chrome’s sync features, and there is no chrome on ARM Linux (even though there is Chromium).</li>
<li>For 90% of my use cases, I rely on FLOSS software. However, while I identify with the OSS ideology, I do not necessarily agree with the hardcore “Open Source or Nothing”. Truthfully, there are tons of amazing software that I require, which do not have an Open Source component at all: because building something like that can become muddled in a community driven aspect. While I alig with the GPL and MIT licenses, I align harder with “use what gets your job done”.</li>
<li>I talked about the Mac and it’s <a href="/blog/on-macos-and-libre-software">prevalence in OSS software</a> early this year. Since then, I have had my Microsoft Surface (running Ubuntu) fail spectacularly on me, and I have completely jumped ship to a MacBook on the laptop front. On the desktop front, I am still hardcore Linux, and I do not see this changing anytime soon, if ever (this is after macOS has become my primary in desktop computing: there’s just so much that Linux helps me get done as well, and again, I am on that “use what gets the job done” bandwagon).</li>
</ol>
<p>So, what does this mean for this project? Truthfully, while Linux is still instrumental to a lot of my computational workflows and I will possibly forever require at least one of my computers to run it forever, the scope of Linux resides in the more advanced stuff. While macOS is UNIX based and lets me do most of the Linux things, I find some more of the advanced things to be well executed on Linux only.</p>

<p>The following series (which is separate from my newsletter), is going to be a comprehensive deep dive into programming for Mac OS version 9: the ancient pre-UNIX version of the Operating System which barely has much documentation on the Internet today. This post is mainly initialization, I just got the VM working and a pipeline to install 3rd party (old) software :)</p>
<p>I do not exactly have a plan in mind, but I hope to be able to share the “why”, and possibly the “how”, in this blog post. I have always been interested in vintage computing, having dabbled with Windows 3.1 in High School for kicks and giggles, to having just completed my Undergraduate Honors Thesis on comparing performance differences between 2 programming languages on the Assembly level. To me, working through the difficulties of programming and figuring out this puzzle is the fun bit in of itself, and what better platform to take than one that shares very little resemblance to any modern OS (Win 9x uses the Windows API which is still used today, and recent macOS is UNIX based).</p>

<p>Worked with Prof. Joe Chiu and Prof. Tim Richards from UMass CICS on my Honors Thesis. I have put a short poster on the project hypothesis below, but obviously not all data is recorded because this is an ongoing project. Moreover, the poster is about 6 months old and a lot has changed in the project (focused on Clang, Cargo, and LLVM).</p>
<p>Regardless, the poster still gives a good idea of what to expect, without giving compromising details, and thus I&rsquo;ll leave it here. Also, there is a git repository which stays private for the forseeable future :)</p>

<p><a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/">The Opportunity Project</a> is a unique research endeavour by the <a href="https://coil.census.gov/">Census Open Innovation Labs</a> which prompts different universities to come up with digital tools built with the help of open government data. Students in each team are paired with industry experts, and follow a range of milestones <a href="https://opportunity.census.gov/our-process/">as described here</a>. The final product is digital (website, app, visualizations, etc.) aimed at different industry experts, which in-turn would help them solve the issue at hand.</p>

<p>Welcome to the second episode of my Newsletter, accompanied by a gorgeous picture of the UMass Amherst West Experimentation Station. I take a lot of pictures in my daily life, but most do not see the light of day, which is why I am going to attempt to merge my different art forms. The Photography page in the Finechive is still under construction, and hopefully it does not take long.</p>

<p>There have been quite a few times when I have talked about aesthetics, and I still believe that they are the best way to express myself. I have a <a href="/blog/liminal-spaces-art-of-appreciating">post here from last year diving into Liminal Spaces</a>, and to this day they capture the feeling of loneliness and eerieness perfectly.</p>
<p>A lot of the pictures I take pertain to outdoor Liminal Spaces. It is an interest that started during the Pandemic lockdowns, especially in a context where I was joining online Zoom meetings from the other corner of the globe. Going from interacting with over 15-20 people at a time on Discord to absolute silence at 4AM on the click of a button, I did not yet realize that I was living in a Liminal Space.</p>

<p>The following document compiles some of the tools I use for my LaTeX fender benders adventures. It is a non-exhaustive list, but should cover most things to get started with, and make your LaTeX life easier.</p>
<h3 id="basic-setup">Basic Setup</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://overleaf.com">Overleaf</a>: An online editor and debugger for LaTeX that works similar to Google Docs. Does not release anything on the Internet unless explicitly specified, and makes it such that you do not have to install LaTeX locally. The error messages are more descriptive as well.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.tug.org/mactex/">MacTeX</a>: I use a Mac, so MacTeX is the official repository to get a local LaTeX install. There&rsquo;s MikTeX for Windows and texlive-full for Linux.</li>
<li><a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop">VS Code LaTeX Workshop</a>: If you do not like TeXStudio, you can use VS Code for editing LaTeX files. Supports ASCII lookups, debuggers, and autofill to make life easier as well. This plugin should be installed after you have a local LaTeX install.</li>
</ul>
