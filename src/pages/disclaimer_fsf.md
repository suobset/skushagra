# A Small Note on the FSF Badge in the Footer

I am a passionate advocate for libre software and a believer in its power to foster freedom, privacy, and collaboration, in line with the principles of the Free Software Foundation (FSF). However, the keyword to be noted is "principles", not people. I do not want to associate myself with any leading members of the FSF, or really anything outside the [4 essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms).

That being said, a small note on rms:

Just gonna mention that it can be hard to separate the art from the artist: I’ve appreciated his stance on Libre Software (even though the stretch on Open Source is a bit too much), and tbh him being super stringent did lead to the initial takeoff of GNU/Linux as we know of it today. Did he make absolutely garbage remarks on almost everything else?? Yes. Do I “look up to him” as some sort of a hero?? No. Does this invalidate his contributions for GNU and Libre Software? Nope. (even though Hurd never came to be)

My only concern is his continued association with the FSF, despite the entire community voting him out in 2019. It’s hard for even the FSF to drive their point home to the general public (and tbh other software folks too) when such a controversial figure maintains a board position. I really support the Free Software Movement (even though open source is a great middle ground), but rms remains a controversial individual, and I am well aware of that. 

Regardless, I appreciate what he’s done for the GNU project, FSF, and remain wary of literally everything else he’s said and controversies he’s been in. I do not associate myself with his views on the world, or really much outside the FSF.

Battling cancer, however, is difficult for any individual, and I wish him a speedy recovery.

As mentioned before, the only reason I support the FSF is due to their unwavering support for Libre Software, that maintain the 4 essential freedoms listed below:


*    The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
*    The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
*    The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help others (freedom 2).
*    The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). By doing this you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes. Access to the source code is a precondition for this.
