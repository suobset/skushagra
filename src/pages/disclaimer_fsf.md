# FSF Membership Badge Disclaimer:

I proudly display my FSF membership badge on my website as a dedicated advocate for libre software. I firmly believe in its capacity to champion freedom, privacy, and collaboration, aligning seamlessly with the core principles of the [Free Software Foundation (FSF)](https://fsf.org). However, it is paramount to emphasize that my allegiance is firmly rooted in these principles, not tied to specific individuals. I do not seek association with prominent figures within the FSF or anything beyond the essential tenets encapsulated by the four fundamental freedoms.

**On Richard Stallman (rms):**

Navigating the realm of contributions and contributors can be complex. I value rms' unwavering commitment to libre software, even though his emphasis on it may seem excessive at times, particularly when considering that Open Source software (which is distinct from free software) has provided a valuable middle ground. His stringent approach played a pivotal role in the initial ascent of GNU/Linux as we know it today, and he continues to make strides in ensuring more accessible software reaches everyone, from developers to users. However, I am acutely aware of his controversial history. **Under no circumstances do I endorse his viewpoints beyond the realm of libre software (GNU and FSF)**.

It is imperative to acknowledge that despite his significant contributions, controversies and criticisms have persisted alongside rms. A pressing concern is his ongoing affiliation with the FSF, despite the community's decision to remove him in 2019. Maintaining a board position can present challenges in effectively conveying the FSF's mission to the broader public and the wider software community. While I remain an unwavering supporter of the Free Software Movement and deeply value rms' contributions to the FSF, GNU/Linux, and the propagation of Free (as in freedom) Software, I am aware of rms' controversial history and positions, with which I do not align.

**Wishing rms Well:**

It is essential to bear in mind that battling cancer presents formidable challenges for anyone, and I extend my heartfelt best wishes for his swift recovery.

**Final Thoughts:**

In conclusion, my support for the FSF is grounded in their unwavering dedication to libre software and the preservation of the [four essential freedoms](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html#four-freedoms):

0. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose (freedom 0).
1. The freedom to study how the program works and adapt it to meet your computing needs (freedom 1). Access to the source code is a prerequisite for this.
2. The freedom to distribute copies to assist others (freedom 2).
3. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others (freedom 3). This empowers you to offer the entire community an opportunity to benefit from your enhancements. Access to the source code is a prerequisite for this.

My unwavering commitment to these principles underscores my dedication to the cause of libre software, unaffected by external factors.
