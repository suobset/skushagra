title: The Finechive - An Archival project by Kush S.

![Banner](./assets-finechive/banner-finechive.png)

A collection of different media that I have documented and archived for fun purposes. The finechive will be ported to the main sidebar once we get more information in this space.

Now obviously, I cannot just link to private or copyrighted media. Thus, this page will contain names of media, and different ways that may help people find their ways to it. I also plan to archive a lot of my own work herein as well. 

After the development of this space is completed, it will be migrated to the main space on the website. Personally, I believe this project will remain a secret for a while, as things like working an archive out do take time: but if anyone wants to find this as a dissapointing easter egg of sorts, I'll leave it here :)
