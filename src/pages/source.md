# Source

This website uses [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io), a static-site generator. The original source was licensed under MIT, with some components that would not work well under [LibreJS](https://www.gnu.org/software/librejs/index.html), thus making it incompatible with certain systems and browsers.

The segments have been removed, and the site is LibreJS compatible, licensed under GNU AGPL.

My goal is to ensure that every piece of code that I write is compatible with every computer on the planet, ranging from fully libre systems like Trisquel, to closed ones like iOS. Moreover, every piece of code I write should respect the user's freedom, regardless of their platform of choice.

More on [why I prefer to use the GPLv3 or AGPL](/disclaimer_fsf), and why it means I only align with FSF's 4 essential freedoms, and not with individuals. Above and beyond, this means that I believe free software that runs on proprietary systems only (such as Windows or Mac) to be free software as well, which many at the FSF call "shackled".
